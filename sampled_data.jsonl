{"id":"898d6387964407fbdf687cc277b25cae","document":"Victim: Four victims (deceased) On the case: Gil Grissom, Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle\n\nGrissom, Nick and Sara arrive on the scene of a mass murder, four Buddhist monks from Thailand lay dead in their temple. Another monk, Ananda, who claims to have been at a bank depositing money they'd gathered to build a school during the murders, called for help. Each victim was shot between the eyes at close range, one at a time. A gang sign belonging to a gang known as \"The Snakebacks\" is carved into the wall. Grissom concludes that they sat still because they were praying for whoever shot them. In a temple garden, Grissom finds a potential murder weapon, a rifle.||||| When the room is processed, Sara extracts a recent boot print from the carpet floor, even though shoes are not supposed to be worn inside a Buddhist temple. She also finds a trace amount of a blue material on a statue and a used chewing gum on another. When Ananda's office is searched, the CSIs find a porn magazine, which is strange since Buddhism discourages seeking pleasure. The lab confirms that the rifle is the murder weapon. It also has Ananda's prints on it. At the autopsy, Doc Robbins explains that the area where all victims were shot corresponds to the Sixth Chakra. In Buddhism, the Chakras are the body's seven energy centers. The Sixth Chakra, also known as \"the Third Eye\", is the hub of higher consciousness. When Ananda is brought in for questioning, he explains that he found the rifle in his office and carried it outdoors because his faith doesn't allow weapons in the temple. The porn magazine was left in the temple by a visitor and Ananda kept it in case that person came back for it.||||| A further fingerprint analysis confirms that Ananda never touched the trigger of the gun; the locations of the prints are consistent with his story that he only carried the gun. Nick suspects that the gang sign is a false lead; after a number of murders, the LVPD came down hard on the Snakebacks and brought the whole gang down. Through David in autopsy, Grissom contacts a local Air Force base. Since 9/11, they keep satellite surveillance of bases and other key buildings. Since the temple is close to a base, it is within the range of a satellite. A photo shows a car with vanity plates \"PROUDUS\" outside the temple close to the time of the murders. The car is registered to Peter Hutchins Sr., a local diner owner who was unhappy with the monks having a temple so close to his establishment, blaming them for the drop in local stores' business. Inside the car, Sara finds a set of prayer beads that doesn't belong to Hutchins Sr.||||| At the lab, the CSIs learn that Peter Hutchins Sr. has an alibi for the murders. Greg examines the blue substance found on a statue and determines that it is paintball paint. Grissom, Nick and Sara visit a nearby paintball field, where Hutchins' son, Pete Hutchins Jr., is playing. Sara compares a shoe print left by his boot to the boot print found on the scene and sees that it is similar. Pete is brought in for questioning, accompanied by his father, and denies having been to the temple.||||| When pressured with the boot print, Pete claims to have brought some friends in to look into the rumors that there was money and drugs inside. When Grissom remarks that the lab's dust lifter only works on recent prints, Pete confesses that a friend took a gold statue from the temple when they were there. He went there to return it and found the monks as he was taking off his boots. He didn't call the police because he was afraid that he would become a suspect. When Grissom asks how he knew he was supposed to remove his boots when entering the temple, Pete admits, to his father's shame, to being interested in Buddhism and considering the monks his friends.||||| With Pete cleared, Greg examines the chewing gum found on a statue and finds trace amounts of curry and saffron on it. Grissom consults with Ananda and presents the lab's findings to him. The spices found on the gum suggest that someone ate them and then chewed the gum. Ananda shows Grissom the temple's kitchen, the cooking of which uses curry and saffron. O'Riley confronts the two with some new evidence: even though the monks raised ca. $13 000 for their charity project, Ananda only deposited $12 000 when he was at the bank. The account was opened the same day as the murders were committed.||||| Before that, Ananda kept the money in a box in his office. Grissom examines the box and finds curry powder inside. Suspicion falls on the temple's part-time cook, David Suddahara, whom Ananda caught stealing from the charity fund, which is why Ananda opened a bank account to keep the money safe. In interrogation, Suddahara confesses to the murders and Grissom confirms that his DNA matches that from the chewing gum from the scene. He thought Ananda was going to report him, went home, got his rifle and returned. Finding that Ananda was gone, he panicked and executed the monks, one by one. When Grissom asks Suddahara why he shot the monks in the Sixth Chakra, he only replies \"I shot them between the eyes.\" With the case closed, Grissom pays a visit to the temple and sees Pete Hutchins Jr. engaged in meditation with a monk.||||| Victim: Stephanie Watson (deceased) On the case: Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown In a separate storyline, Catherine meets up with Jimmy Tadero, her old mentor, at bar. Catherine brings up Dwight Kelso, who was convicted of killing her best friend, Stephanie Watson, during her dancer days. Kelso, who recently died of cancer in prison, made a television appearance on his deathbed. He confessed to killing a man in Reno, but maintains that he didn't kill Stephanie. Even though Kelso had been seen harassing her at the bar and had a knife cut on his hand when he was arrested a block away from the murder site, Catherine still feels insecure about the case. Together with Warrick, she signs out the case evidence, which is due to be destroyed, and re-examines it in the lab. When she and Greg examine the murder weapon, a bloody knife, they notice a small spot of blood that wasn't examined at the time of the murder. Catherine figures that it was ignored because the lab couldn't get a DNA sample from such a small amount.||||| When the test results come back, they show that the small spot is not from Kelso or Stephanie, but a third contributor, a male. Ecklie is initially a bit angry that the evidence was signed out without his knowledge, but gets onboard when he learns of the new evidence. In the display room, Warrick goes over the crime scene photos and notices that a glove that belonged to Kelso and was found on the scene isn't in a single crime scene photo or sketch. Catherine becomes suspicious when she learns that it was logged by Jimmy - two days after the murder. Catherine takes Jimmy to the crime scene to go over the crime again. He shows her the dumpster in which the glove was found, claiming the arresting officer didn't see the glove because it was dark and he was busy grabbing Kelso. Jimmy is offended when Catherine asks whether he tampered with the evidence.||||| Back at the lab, Warrick runs more tests on the knife and finds remains of saliva in the blood on both the glove and the knife - Kelso's saliva. Catherine suspects that the blood came from a mouth injury and was then transferred from the glove onto the knife. She confronts Jimmy, who admits that he \"helped the evidence along\". When Kelso was arrested, the DA didn't feel like there was enough non-circumstantial evidence to charge him with the murder and he was released. Jimmy attacked Kelso outside, beating him while he taunted him about the murder. Jimmy then shoved the glove into his face, where blood from his beaten mouth stained it. He then transferred some of the blood from the glove onto the knife, planting DNA evidence. Catherine tells him that, with all the new information, Jimmy is a suspect for the murder himself since he had a crush on Stephanie and even proposed to her a week before she was killed, though she turned him down. He refuses to give her a sample of his DNA without a warrant, which Catherine gets.||||| When the DNA test results come back, Jimmy is brought in for questioning. The test proves that the blood on the knife is not his, nor is it a match to anyone connected to the case or anyone in CODIS. Jimmy is furious when he learns that Catherine will make sure he is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, even though he could get life in prison or even the death penalty. He calls Catherine ungrateful, saying she would have started prostituting herself if he hadn't gotten her out of dancing. Catherine rebuts this, saying she earned her career as a CSI and only danced. She remarks that Jimmy sold his integrity to get a case solved and because of that, the real killer got away with it. She asks \"Between the two of us, who's the whore?\". She promises to follow Jimmy all the way through his proceedings and has him arrested. In the final scene of the episode, Catherine returns the Stephanie Watson evidence to the storage and marks the box \"DO NOT DESTROY - CASE UNSOLVED\".","summary":"Grissom, Sara and Nick investigate the death of four Buddhist monks who were shot to death in their monastery near Vegas. Catherine re-opens the murder of an old friend, when the man that was convicted for the murder claims he is innocent on his deathbed.

Tomme's spirit animal tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Wanadi warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic Fierce People.||||| Meanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors.

Tomme and his father manage to escape, leaving Markham's carbine behind. In the care of the Invisible People, Markham recovers from his injuries and discovers that his son has chosen a wife, a young woman named Kachiri (Dira Paes). Jacareh, recognizing the destructive power of Markham's carbine, visits a seedy brothel at the edge of the construction zone and arranges to exchange women for ammunition and more guns.||||| Wanadi presides over the wedding, with Markham seated in honour next to the chief; Markham watches as Tomme and Kachiri are wedded; he is still grief-stricken, even still upset with Wanadi, for his son being taken; Markham asks Chief Wanadi why he took Tommy all those years ago. Wanadi answered that he thought the white people must be terribly unhappy, since they were destroying the forest, but Tommy smiled at the Invisible People when he saw them; the Chief took Tommy to save him. Wanadi has Markham given the herb to instigate Markham's own vision quest, and he wakes up back at the dam's construction zone. Tomme and his friends return to their village to discover that many of the Invisible People have been murdered and all the young women abducted by the Fierce People.||||| Tracking the Fierce People, they find their women inside a building protected by unfamiliar, and deadly, technology.

Desperate for help, Tomme navigates the city to his parents' condo, and Markham agrees to help rescue the women from the brothel. That night, Markham initiates a shootout in the brothel while Tomme and his friends release the enslaved women from captivity. Tomme is later sworn in as the new chief of the tribe. Markham warns Tomme that the almost-completed dam will end the tribe's way of life, but Tomme insists that the Invisible People are safe and they will ask the wildlife to bring on sufficient rain to break the dam. During the storm, Markham places demolition explosives at key points along the dam, but the detonator seems to fail. It is not clear if either the explosives or the storm manages to breach the dam. Markham watches its destruction with mixed emotions.

He also talks incessantly about video games. One wonders if he really is the key to saving humanity. Later that night, Abraham sits with Tara and suggests that she might have complicated feelings for Glenn. Tara alludes to the fact that she is helping Glenn because of something in her past, something she did. \"We've both got our reasons,\" she says. \"We both have our missions.\" The next day, the group comes upon a sign written in blood. \"Glenn, go to Terminus.

The priest knows who Steve is by letters he had written to Paolo talking about a woman named Nina, and asks Steve to tell him about the war. Steve relates what happened in 1944, when Italy was still occupied by the Germans: As a fighter pilot and squadron leader in Corsica, Steve completes his 200th mission and is about to be shipped home. When his replacement and good friend, Captain George Peterson, does not return from a mission needed for the impending invasion of Italy, Steve decides to take his place the next day. The squad cannot identify their strategic target, a tunnel that houses a German munitions supply, and Steve is forced to parachute out of his plane after it is hit.||||| Although the German ground soldiers see Steve's descent, he eludes them and seeks help from a local farmer. The farmer's wife fears the Germans and turns him away, but Steve is soon approached by Nina, a young woman who is part of an Italian guerrilla force. Nina leads Steve to a mountain cabin where he meets Bruno, leader of the small band. Although he is a patriot, Bruno fears that Steve's presence will bring severe retaliations against the villagers, including his mother, and tells Steve that he will have to stay put before finding his way back to Corsica. A few days later, Steve sees a formation of American planes fly overhead and realizes that the target still eludes them. He and Nina, who are attracted to each other, kiss, even though Steve has told her that he has a girl at home. Later, Steve tells Bruno that he is planning to leave that night.||||| Although Aldo, an embittered member of the band who is in love with Nina, lashes out at Steve, Bruno defends him and agrees to help. In the afternoon, the men go down from the hills, stop a German Panzer with a grenade and steal its weapons. A few minutes later, a truck full of German soldiers arrives, but the Italians manage to escape. Back at the cabin, Steve tells the men about the tunnel, but Bruno and the others are afraid that if they help, German retaliation will be too severe. Nina lashes out at the men for being too afraid to take chances, then leaves the cabin. Steve follows her and kisses her, promising that he will be with her even after the war, but telling her that she cannot come with him now. She agrees, but asks him to wait until morning when Father Paolo, who is a fearless patriot, can help him.||||| The next day, Nina takes Steve to see Fr. Paolo, who has been hiding George in the church since he was shot down. Paolo then reveals that Bruno's mother died when she fell from a truck, trying to escape from the Germans. Just then, two German soldiers barge in, with guns drawn. Nina distracts the soldiers by screaming, and in the melee, the Germans are killed. George, Nina and Steve then return to the cabin. On the way, they see a German roadblock and Nina distracts the soldiers long enough for George and Steve to capture them. That night, at the cabin, Nina tells Bruno what happened to his mother and he decides to help Steve blow up the tunnel.||||| During the planning, they observe that Aldo is gone, and when he returns carrying a goat, Nina is suspicious because Aldo hates goats. Later, the men notice an unusually large number of German patrols. At the same time, two of the men, Mario and Ettore, are captured by the Germans while getting supplies. Although Ettore is killed, Mario escapes. Meanwhile, at the cabin, Bruno begins to suspect that there is a spy in the group. Just then Mario comes back and tells them what happened. Convinced that someone is a traitor, Bruno suggests a secret vote to determine who it is. Steve does not like this, and refuses to vote, but everyone else, except Aldo, names Aldo. Bruno is about to beat the truth out of Aldo when German soldiers approach the cabin in force.||||| Bruno and the others tie Aldo to a chair and shoot their way out, leaving Aldo to be killed by the Germans. Next morning, Steve, George and the others move into place to blow up the tunnel, while American planes fly overhead. After Steve lights a flare he has kept in his pocket, some of the planes investigate, identify the semi-obscured target and start to bomb it. While the Italians take out some of the German artillery crews, Bruno is killed, but the rest manage to direct one of the large guns to explode the ammunition, thus destroying the tunnel. A short time later, on the coast, Paolo and other patriots help Steve and George escape in a small boat. After kissing Nina goodbye, Steve promises to come back, but Paolo warns her that soldiers are known for short memories. As Steve ends his story, the priest answers his door and a small boy steps aside to reveal Nina.

Once he's changed and dressed in his special birthday outfit (which consist of a Mario-like red T-shirt with overalls instead of what will be the series normal of light blue T-shirt and diaper) Didi takes him downstairs for breakfast before his party begins. Didi and Stu feel thoroughly prepared for this special occasion by consulting Lipschitz and creating a birthday checklist. The adults don't notice that Tommy is watching a dog food commercial on TV. Feeling inspired by the ad, Tommy breaks out of his highchair and crawls over to his dog Spike's food bowl (full of canned dog food). At the last minute Grandpa Lou catches Tommy and tells him he doesn't want dog food, he wants his baby food breakfast. But when Lou looks at Tommy's baby food he admits that dog food does look more appetizing by comparison!||||| The day rolls on and Betty and Howard DeVille arrive for the party with their twins, Phil and Lil, and Chuckie Finster, the neighbors' son. When they're all gathered in the playpen, Tommy tells them about the dog food commercial, and his belief that if they eat dog food, they'll turn into dogs. The other babies find this appealing and decide they want to be dogs, too.||||| But before they can leave the playpen, the grownups put party hats on the babies and snap pictures, though the babies aren't thrilled by either one. Soon, Stu's older brother Drew arrives with his daughter Angelica (who, not unlike Tommy, is wearing a special birthday party dress for the occasion). Angelica gleefully poses for pictures with the babies, though roughly. Tommy tells Angelica about the dog food, who enjoys the idea of biting the mailman and agrees to go along with Tommy's plan to get dog food. But before they can do anything, it's time to open presents. Angelica is greedy and wants Tommy's presents for herself. Stu made Tommy's present himself: a remote control flying saucer. Didi and Grandpa Lou both doubt that even a grownup can fly it, but Stu insists Tommy can figure it out.||||| The doorbell rings, signaling the arrival of the puppet stand and puppets the Pickles' booked for the party. But there are no professional puppeteers to go with the stand, leaving Stu and Drew to perform themselves (and Didi worrying that her son's first birthday won't be perfect). They decide to perform the climax of Little Red Riding Hood, but they quickly begin to argue over how the lines go. Lou tries to tell them to cut it out (with a puppet of his own), however it doesn't work and they continue to bicker. Meanwhile Grandpa Boris, Didi's father, complains about the cake she baked. Didi baked a carrot cake, but Boris says a chocolate cake is more suitable.||||| With the adults distracted, first Tommy, then the rest of the gang, go to the kitchen, but find Spike's bowl licked clean. They find another can on the counter, but have difficulties getting it down on their own. They use Stu's present to help, but wreck the kitchen and the cake in the process! Fortunately, Lou opens the can of dog food for Spike. Spike isn't interested in eating right now, so the babies eagerly help themselves...and quickly spit it out (except for Lil)! Nothing happens at first, but then Tommy says he feels something, and starts to bark and crawl around. Phil and Lil say they have fleas, Chuckie hopes he can grow fur, and Angelica hopes the mailman comes soon. All of them start acting like dogs, which attracts the notice of the adults. They feel happy seeing this moment, because even though the day was far from perfect, they're all having a good time. A picture of this is taken, which is forever included on the pages of the Pickles family photo album documenting Tommy's first birthday.","summary":"In this episode we meet Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Angelica, Grandpa, and the rest of the gang for the first time at Tommy's birthday party.

Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's new psychiatrist after Dr. Loomis' death, inform them that Michael is able to speak, but chooses not to.||||| Dana records the event as Aaron approaches Michael and talks to him, but fails to get him to speak, even after showing him his mask and mentioning Laurie Strode. The two journalists leave Smith's Grove Sanitarium and drive to Laurie's house, a heavily fortified and decrepit homestead, and bribe her for an interview, which she reluctantly accepts. Laurie has spent the last forty years dealing with post-traumatic stress and preparing for Michael's inevitable return. Her feelings have resulted in two failed marriages and losing custody of her daughter Karen at a young age. Aaron and Dana tell Laurie their interest in finding out why Michael committed the murders in 1978 and ask her to meet with him in a final attempt to get him to speak before he's transferred to a maximum security prison. Laurie kicks them out of her house, but not before taking the money they offered.||||| Allyson with her friends As the transport is being prepared and patients are loaded onto the bus, Dr. Sartain insists on accompanying Michael, and the bus departs. In Haddonfield, Laurie's granddaughter and Karen's daughter, Allyson, is walking to school with two friends and tells them the stress that her family endures due to her grandmother's past, and debunks the town rumor that Michael is Laurie's brother. In class, Allyson looks out of the window to see Laurie watching her.||||| She meets with her grandmother who gives her the three thousand dollars from Aaron and Dana and tells her to have fun. During a family dinner at Karen's house, Laurie arrives and has a panic attack and Allyson comforts her. Meanwhile, the bus transport crashed in a ditch, the security guards were killed, and the inmates were scattered about the road. A man and his son driving down the road happen upon the bus and investigate. While the father disappears, his son grabs a rifle from the truck and encounters a fatally wounded security guard that tells him to run. He investigates the bus and is startled by Dr. Sartain, shooting him in the shoulder accidentally. Fleeing back to the truck, he calls the police; Michael appears from the back seat and kills him.||||| The following morning, Sheriff Frank Hawkins explains to a deputy that Michael Myers escaped the transport and will most certainly return to Haddonfield to finish what he started four decades prior. Aaron and Dana arrive at a gas station; Dana leaves Aaron to use the bathroom while he goes inside to pay for the gas. With the inside of the station deserted, he stumbles upon a dead mechanic missing his overalls and a cashier whose jaw was ripped open. Meanwhile, Michael attacks Dana in the bathroom, and when Aaron arrives to save Dana, Michael kills him by bashing him into the door numerous times, killing him, before strangling Dana to death. Michael inspects their vehicle and recovers his mask, putting it on. Laurie learns about the transport crash and breaks into Karen's house to demonstrate her lack of security. After a brief argument about Michael with Karen and her husband, Ray, Laurie leaves and heads to the gas station in time to witness the bodies of Aaron and Dana being recovered.||||| On Halloween night, Michael wanders a populated street in Haddonfield, littered with families and children trick-or-treating. He finds his way into a shed behind a house and takes a hammer before going inside to kill the sole occupant. He replaces the hammer with a kitchen knife and moves to the house next door, killing another woman by stabbing the knife through her throat. Allyson is at a school-sanctioned Halloween party with her friends and receives a call from Vicky, inviting her to come over once Julian, the kid she's babysitting, falls asleep.||||| Allyson gets into an altercation with her boyfriend, Cameron, who throws her phone, just as Laurie was calling to warn her to go home. At Julian's house, he tells Vicky that he saw a masked man standing in the doorway, but Vicky dismisses it as his imagination and puts Julian to bed as her boyfriend, Dave, arrives. As Vicky checks the closet at Julian's request, she opens the door and is attacked by Michael who was hiding inside; Julian flees the house and calls the police. Laurie, patrolling the streets in her truck, hears the dispatch call on her CB radio and hurries to the house, where Sheriff Hawkins is investigating. He finds Vicky's corpse and Laurie shoots Michael through a window, only to find out it's his reflection in a mirror. Laurie and Hawkins patrol behind the neighboring houses and find Michael; Laurie shoots him, but as she turns the corner, Michael is gone.||||| Laurie and Allyson\n\nAllyson ditches her boyfriend at the party and allows her friend Oscar to walk her home. Allyson rejects his advances and Oscar lags behind, spotting Michael watching him. Oscar tries to escape, but is caught on a fence and Michael impales him. Allyson turns back and finds Oscar's body and is chased by Michael before finding refuge in a neighboring home. Karen and Ray arrive at Laurie's fortified home and wait for Allyson to arrive.||||| Hawkins encounters Dr. Sartain and in turn, find Allyson during their search for Michael. Finding Michael, Hawkins runs him over with the police SUV and gets out of the vehicle to shoot Michael at point-blank range, despite Dr. Sartain's protests. Dr. Sartain stabs Hawkins in the throat with a blade hidden inside of a pen and kills him before taking Michael's mask and trying it on. Dr. Sartain loads Michael into the back of the vehicle with Allyson and drives to Laurie's house, intent on reuniting them. Michael regains consciousness and reclaims his mask, and Allyson informs Dr. Sartain that Michael spoke to her; distracted by demanding to know what Michael said, Michael breaks through the security barrier, forces Dr. Sartain out of the vehicle, and stomps on his head as Allyson flees on foot.||||| Ray steps outside to offer coffee to the police officers stationed outside Laurie's house and finds them dead. Michael appears behind Ray and strangles him. Laurie alerts Karen to Michael's arrival and sends her into the hidden safe room as she locks and barricades the front door. Michael breaks through the glass panels in the door and attacks Laurie, who escapes by shooting Michael's hand with a shotgun, stripping him of two fingers, forcing him to retreat.

Singam had previously covered his relationship with his wife Kavya Mahalingam to keep her away from enemies, and after curiosity from Constable Veeram, he closes it as a divorce, revealing it only to Inspector Subba Rao.\n\nAfter briefly confronting Bheemli Selvam, Reddy's man who ordered the attack at the train station, Singam finds that a constable at the station has gotten sick from consuming an expired medicine tablet. With help from a paroled hacker named Murali, Singam tracks Mallaiya who drove Ramakrishna to Vizag harbour on the night of the murder. A local schoolteacher informs Singam that a toxic smoke attack from the nearby dump killed his 32 students, including his grandchildren. Singam realizes that Ramakrishna intended to expose illegal dumping of mediwaste and electronic waste, which included recycled tablets being sold to the public and the smoke attack on the school. The garbage is being imported by Vizag Scraps owner Rajeev Krishna in exchange for free metal scrap delivery to steel companies in Australia. Mallaiya confirms that Reddy, who authorizes this business in India killed Ramakrishna to prevent him from thwarting his operation. Both Reddy and Rajeev's activities are supervised by wealthy Australian Export minister and Businessman named Vittal Prasad, who receives full support from his father, Union Minister Ram Prasad. In the meantime, Vidya writes an article on Singam claiming that he exported Reddy for personal gain and that he is corrupt, putting Singam's reputation at edge. Singam begins to eliminate and arrest criminals all over the city, including Selvam whom he guns down. Later on, he heads to Vizag harbour to obtain evidence from Reddy's containers but is attacked by his men while Ravi murders the school teacher. Vittal calls Singam anonymously and threatens to use his influence to kill Singam's family if he doesn't stand down.\n\nThe next day, Singam chases down Ravi and arrests Reddy. He pays a personal visit to Vittal in Australia from looking into Reddy's contacts, and confirms that he's the one behind the illegal dumping. He narrowly escapes Vittal and returns to India, where he finds that Reddy has been bailed by three criminals, who framed the Commissioner for supposed sexual assault on one of their wives, and justify the murder as revenge. Singam is also fired from the CBI for speaking out of turn, and has Vidya pay a fine for discrediting him. Singam has the home minister transfer him as a Andhra pradesh cop in Vizag to continue pursuing Reddy's men. He exposes the garbage containers to the public, forcing Vittal to come to Vizag. When Vittal warns him again to stay out of his way, Singam responds by having Subbu Rao kill Reddy, whom previously killed his nine-year-old son in a city riot to defend Ram Prasad's position. Singam brings Vittal to his station and gives him another chance to repent for whom he's hurt. Singam and Kavya later visit Thoothukudi to attend Kavya's grandma's funeral. They are followed by Rajeev, who is arrested. When Vidya attempts to interview Vittal, she is captured and drugged. With help from Murali, Singam rescues Vidya but is targeted by Vittal's men who bomb the police station. Singam decides to finish this once and for all and gets an arrest warrant for Vittal using computer evidence of agreements signed with medical companies, hacked by Murali. The next day, Singam pursues Vittal all the way to an airport in Telangana and has him arrested. Vittal escapes custody into a nearby forest, where Singam catches him and after a long fight kills him for self defense.\n\nDuring the credits, Singam regains his post and respect while Ram Prasad is removed from cabinet position for assisting his son. Kavya is revealed to be pregnant six months later and Vidya severes contact with Singam after getting engaged to a good prospect. Singam's boss, Tamil Nadu home minister Ramanathan calls him in for another mission."}

Although one wonders if Sheldon had spent more time with the razor and scissors, as he bears more of a resemblance to the evil Mr. Spock (or perhaps Howie Mandel with hair) than the Geico Insurance cavemen look the other three were sporting. Naturally, Sheldon thought the expedition went wonderfully. Perhaps it was because his mom's church group prayed for his safety. (Well, she thinks it worked and told Sheldon that.) To be fair, Leonard found the return home pretty good. Of course, having Penny practically jump him, kiss him passionately, and drag him into her apartment might have had something to do with it. HOWARD: Dammit.||||| I should have gone over and told her we were back. RAJ: (sarcastically) Yeah. It was \"first come, first serve.\" To say Sheldon was pleased with the results of his experiments would be an understatement. Although he appreciated the contributions of Howard and Raj, he can't mention them in his Nobel acceptance speech. However, they will get an effusive footnote (and a signed copy!) of his memoirs. This would probably be a good time to tell Sheldon the truth, since Sheldon's Vulcan hearing can pick up whispers from another room. Sheldon thinks they want to talk about having to sleep together naked to conserve body heat the one night the power went out. What Sheldon thought were magnetic monopoles he discovered to prove String Theory correct were actually caused by operating the electric can opener and causing static. The reason they did that is because Sheldon wasn't finding any at first and he started acting like an obnoxious giant dictator.||||| RAJ: I thought we were going to be gentle with him. HOWARD: That's why I added the \"-tator\". It helped the guys from not wanting to kill Sheldon because it made him colon-Capital D. (in the world of emoticons) Finding this out made Sheldon become colon-Captial O. He feels betrayed, especially by Leonard. Sheldon demands to see Leonard, who would prefer not interrupting his makeout session with Penny. (BTW Kaley, whatever you were doing during hiatus, keep doing that.) Since Leonard refuses to answer to Sheldon's knock, Sheldon decides to demand to talk to Penny. SHELDON: I realize you're currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have a lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one? Sheldon tells how the three fed him false data in his experiments. Penny wants to know why. Leonard says it was to keep him happy and prevent them from throwing Sheldon's Kindle outside and then locking him out when he went to get it.||||| SHELDON: That seems like a bit of an overreaction! LEONARD: No. An overreaction would be to tie your limbs to 4 different sled dog teams and yell \"mush!\" The original data was still available, but Sheldon already sent an email claiming he solved String Theory. Sending a retraction email would humiliate Sheldon in front of the whole university. Penny takes Sheldon's side in this and goes to talk to him. She tries her best, even singing Soft Kitty, which only works when he is sick. He's unconsolable, since not only was the three months at the North Pole for nothing, he missed Comic Con. Penny tries, though. She tells him a story about being told a rumor she would be head cheerleader in high school before they named Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader (the big ol' slutbag!). She was devastated. Her mom even made her a celebratory pie. SHELDON: Are you saying a celebration pie is even comparable to a Nobel prize?||||| PENNY: Well, they're pretty tasty. SHELDON: And on a different but not unrelated topic, based on your efforts to buoy my spirits, do you think you were ever fit to be a cheer-LEADER? OK, one more try. Penny tries to compare what the guys did to the new Star Trek movie when Kirk took over the ship and told Spock all those things that weren't true, like not caring his mother died. SHELDON: I missed Comic Con AND the new Star Trek movie!!! (he's bawling like a 3-year-old)||||| At the university, the guys have shaved, except for Howard's mustache. (the \"Clooney\" or the \"Mario and Luigi\", depending on your opinion) Leonard is spared having to give too many details about whether he and Penny had sex as Sheldon comes in and refuses to sit with them...and unsuccessfully tries to choke Leonard by using The Force. They try to apologize again, but he's not having it. Having Kripke come in and telling Sheldon he \"destwoyed his weputation\" with the retwaction email didn't help. Sheldon tries to defend himself to the cafeteria by invoking the \"biggest blunder\" Einstein admitted to, but since that blunder was later proven correct, that makes Sheldon a big \"woser.\"||||| Leonard returns to Penny to give her the gift he wanted before getting interrupted: a preserved snowflake from the North Pole. He begins to explain how he preserved it, but this apparently is the most effective way to get Penny to kiss him. He is again interrupted by Howard and Raj, who report that Sheldon has resigned from the university and went back to Texas, based on the phone call Leonard receives from Sheldon's mother.||||| Her powers of persuasion are not limited to working on Sheldon, as the three of them are on a plane to Texas to bring him back. (Penny promises to still be there when they get back.) LEONARD: I don't want to go to Texas! HOWARD: And I do? My people already crossed the desert once. We're done! At home, Sheldon is getting used to doing things the way he used to, which includes prayer before every meal. But his mom was nice enough to cut a smiley face into his grilled cheese, so a little \"God's neat, let's eat\" never hurt anybody. She recalls that they had sat together like this when he was a kid, when the neighborhood kids would hate him. Sheldon thinks they were too stupid to know they hated him because of his intelligence, but actually they did know that.||||| Leonard, Howard, and Raj make it down there. Raj is disappointed he won't get to see a cattle drive, but at least they have steaks on sale at the Costco. It turns out Raj can't talk to Sheldon's mother, either. However, a woman at her church might be able to do a healing thing she does with the crutch and wheelchair crowd, and she might be willing to take a shot at \"whatever Third World demon is rolling around\" in him. Leonard wants to get back to L.A. quickly. (\"A girl?||||| I've been praying for you.\") She calls Sheldon out, but Sheldon refuses their apology, as he is convinced he is now destined to teach Evolution to a bunch of Creationists. MRS. COOPER: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone's entitled to their opinion. SHELDON: Evolution is not opinion, it's fact. MRS. COOPER: And that is YOUR opinion! (pause)\n\nSHELDON: I forgive you. Let's go home! MRS. COOPER: Don't tell me prayer doesn't work! Finally returning to L.A. Leonard can get back to Penny, and they FINALLY have sex! Leonard doesn't see why it has to be weird for friends to have sex. They were friends, and now they're more than friends. It is what it is. PENNY: Leonard? It's weird. LEONARD: Totally.","summary":"Leonard, you're back!\n\nFollowing his return from the North Pole, Sheldon is very excited over the prospects that his research has yielded, whereas Raj , Howard , and Leonard are just glad to be home after spending three months at the North Pole in close quarters with Sheldon.

Leonard explains that he did it because Sheldon was being absolutely unbearable during the expedition when he wasn't getting the results he wanted. Plans to kill him were even brought up and discussed. To make matters worse, Sheldon already contacted everyone at the university that he had positive results.

Things go well at first, but everything changes after discovering a tunnel in the basement leading into the house from an unknown place. An evil presence is shown to be lurking within, unknown to the family. Unusual and paranormal activities occur, such as unknown forces banging on the door at night when nobody is outside and an ugly demonic message painted on the wall of Janice's room.||||| For the latter, Anthony blames and beats his children, Jan and Mark, then beats Dolores for intervening, resulting in a fight between the entire family. Concerned by these developments, Dolores tries to have the local Catholic priest, Father Frank Adamsky, bless the house, but an argument breaks out within the family shortly after Adamsky arrives. After Anthony shouts and hits the younger children, Adamsky tries to intervene but Anthony rudely orders him to leave. To Dolores' mortification, Adamsky leaves, disgusted at Anthony's behavior. He finds his car door open and the Bible on the passenger seat torn to pieces. The situation inside the home continues to deteriorate; Anthony is shown to be strict, abusive, sacrilegious towards the Catholic faith, violent towards his family and forcing his wife to have sex with him against her will. Dolores tries to keep things together for the youngest children. Also, Sonny and Patricia are revealed to have started to have sexual feelings for each other, due to mutual attraction that neither can act on.||||| The family goes to church with Anthony, so he can apologize for being rude to Adamsky. Sonny stays at home, claiming to feel unwell. He soon hears an alarming noise and goes downstairs to get his father's gun. He hears demonic laughter and follows it to the tunnel in the basement. The unseen presence pursues a frightened Sonny to his room, and he then falls victim to a demonic possession. Now possessed, Sonny approaches Patricia to play a game with him. They pretend he is a famous photographer and she is his nude model. Patricia agrees to pose naked and the pair end up having incestuous sex.||||| Patricia is then seen at confession, confessing the act and telling the priest that he does it to \"hurt God\" but not quite revealing who the culprit is. Sonny becomes more sinister and demonic, as his face starts contorting demonically. Startled, he tries to keep his family away, but is unsuccessful due to the demon's influence. On Sonny's birthday, he isolates himself from his birthday party, calls Patricia and she goes to check on him. She tells him she does not feel guilty about what they have been doing, but due to his demonic phases and his body's gradual demonic contortions, Sonny sends her away, using foul language. Patricia runs away crying, and she tries to tell Adamsky that she thinks Sonny is possessed, but he does not respond. Later that night, the evil spirit tells Sonny to \"kill them all\". Sonny goes and gets his father's rifle, and shoots his parents, Jan, Mark, and Patricia, after hunting her down.||||| The next day the cops arrive, pick up the bodies, and Sonny is arrested. He lies and says he does not recall killing his family. Adamsky then realizes that Sonny is possessed and asks the bishops if he can perform an exorcism on him, but they refuse, not believing him. He takes it upon himself to perform an exorcism, without the support of the Catholic Church. After freeing him from police custody, he takes Sonny to church. Sonny attacks him, and escapes after seeing the crosses on the doors. Adamsky runs after Sonny, traces him to the house, and performs the exorcism, releasing Sonny's soul.

As high school senior Bianca Piper (Mae Whitman) explains, now jocks play video games, the princesses are on anti-depressants, and the nerds are in charge. We then see the short, slightly-overweight unattractive Bianca walking down the halls with her two attractive best friends: Jessica 'Jess' Harris (Skyler Samuels), an aspiring fashion designer, and Casey Cordero (Bianca A. Santos), a tough computer hacker girl. All the guys drool over Jess and Casey, but nobody ever really acknowledges Bianca. The school's ruthless mean-girl queen bee Madison Morgan (Bella Thorne) invites Jess and Casey to a party at her house, and deliberately chooses not to invite Bianca, until Casey makes it so that there's a free invitation. Here, we also meet Bianca's neighbor and former friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), captain of the football team and Madison's on/off boyfriend. Bianca also has a crush on a guy named Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman), but she is too scared to say more than two words to him.||||| The supervisor of the school newspaper and Bianca's teacher, Mr. Arthur (Ken Jeong), assigns her the task of writing an article for the school newspaper on the upcoming homecoming dance and what social life means to her. She reluctantly agrees to it. At home, we meet Bianca's mom Dottie (Allison Janney), who became a successful author after her divorce. She was inspired by an episode of \"The Simpsons\" to create a book on the five stages of dealing with divorce.||||| She, along with Jess and Casey, convince Bianca to go to the party, despite her hesitance. At the party, Wes runs into Bianca and asks her if Jess and Casey have mentioned him or are interested in him. Bianca says it's not her job to divulge information on her friends, to which Wes argues that it is as their DUFF. Wes explains to a confused Bianca that it stands for the \"Designated Ugly Fat Friend\", and that a DUFF is there to make their friends look better by comparison. They are approachable enough for someone to ask them about their hot friends, and Bianca fits this role. Offended, she throws her drink in Wes's face. She goes home alone feeling insecure and self-conscious.||||| Throughout the rest of the day, the thought of being a DUFF bugs Bianca until she realizes that everyone only talks to her to get closer to Jess and Casey. She even notices all the other social cliques at school with their own DUFF. It gets to a point where Bianca confronts Jess and Casey about being their DUFF. Despite their assurance that they don't see her like that, Bianca spitefully unfollows them from every form of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Vine, etc.) and decides she doesn't want to be friends with them at all. Bianca notices that Wes is failing chemistry. She sees this as an opportunity for the two of them to help each other out. She offers to tutor Wes if he agrees to turn her image around so that she won't be a DUFF. Wes agrees, but only if Bianca asks him in her monster voice from when they were kids. She does.||||| Wes joins Bianca at the local shopping mall where he first gets her to dress in a more flattering manner. As Bianca tries on different outfits, she fools around with a mannequin and pretends it's Toby. From afar, Madison's minion Caitlyn (Rebecca Weil) films this and sends the video to Madison. Wes then challenges Bianca to go around the mall and talk to a bunch of random guys for her to get over her fear of talking to Toby. It goes awkwardly for a while until one guy from a frozen yogurt stand talks to Bianca for a while. The next day, the video of Bianca at the mall goes viral throughout the school. Everybody points and laughs at her, forcing her to run into the bathroom and cry. Mr. Arthur and Principal Buchanon (Romany Malco) take notice of this and demand everybody turn in their cell phones to prevent further cyberbullying, which only turns everyone against Bianca even more since they blame her for the loss of their gadgets. Jess and Casey also see the video, and Casey gets rid of the video. The phones are returned to the students when the constant ringing bothers Buchanon.||||| Wes comes over to Bianca's house to apologize for not stopping the video and for not defending her. He gives her a dress that she had her eye on at the mall. He tells her not to let the video get to her and that she should approach Toby personally and admit how she feels. Wes then promises to go out and continue studying. Bianca approaches Toby at school after being previously humiliated by the video. She tells him she's into him, and he invites her to go over to his house to hang out. Bianca takes Wes into the nearby woods to her \"thinking rock\" so he can tell her how to handle herself on a date. He explains how the mood should be set and how Toby would act if he is trying to go for a kiss. Wes ends up kissing Bianca, but they laugh it off as just practice. Once again, Caitlyn is in the distance filming this with her video phone. Madison then approaches Bianca at school the next day and threatens to post another video at the mall of Bianca's awkward encounter with the guys since Madison doesn't like Bianca hanging around Wes.||||| Another evening or two later, Bianca goes to Toby's house for dinner. He puts out sushi and talks about how he got into writing songs. However, Bianca cannot stop thinking about Wes. She goes to the bathroom and tries to convince herself that she's not into him. Outside, Toby plays an awkwardly-written song for Bianca and then asks about Jess and Casey. Bianca slowly realizes that Toby is DUFF-ing her, and he admits he only invited Bianca over because he thought Jess and Casey would be joining them. Bianca leaves and then sees that Toby bought the sushi from another place instead of cooking it like he made it seem. Bianca goes home and leaves a message for Wes. She walks by the woods and sees him and Madison sitting on her rock, kissing. Wes comes over later to comfort Bianca, only to be turned away after she tells him what she saw.||||| Depressed, Bianca tries to write her article, only to become lonely.

Jess makes Bianca a dress using Bianca's flannel shirt and another dress. The three girls go to the homecoming dance, and everyone is stunned by Bianca's new look, including Wes.

Repulsed by the mental image, Giles tells him to go and get some himself since he will no longer eat them now.||||| Xander and Anya arrive, arguing about whether Xander really loves her or -- because Xander can't vocalize the way he feels -- is only interested in her for sex. Her open voice on sex with Xander causes Giles to be repulsed and uncomfortable by it while Spike just finds Xander's situation amusing. Giles informs Xander that he has to keep Spike with him for a few days because an old girlfriend of his will be coming over from England. None of them are particularly pleased about the arrangement: Xander can't trust Spike to be in the same room as him without restraints, and Spike doesn't particularly want to be around Xander or Anya, especially if they intend to be intimate with him while he is tied to a chair in the same room. The three argue back and forth with Giles wearily in the middle.||||| Willow goes to her Wicca meeting but soon finds the girls are just wannabe Wiccans with no knowledge of real magicks . When Willow mentions the possibility of performing spells, the leader of the group just ridicules her. However, while the rest of wannabe Wiccans laugh one member, a girl called Tara , grows interested when Willow mentions actually performing magic. She tries to agree with Willow's suggestion, however she is very shy and after gathering the courage to speak up is quickly intimidated back into silence by the others. Willow realizes she's never going to learn anything from this group and speaks about it to Buffy, who complains to Willow how slowly her relationship with Riley is progressing, while Riley discusses the same with Forrest ; both conclude that the reason they cannot progress their relationship is because of both their inability to reveal their true identities to each other and the fact that Buffy starts babbling.||||| That night, before going to bed, Xander ties Spike down to a chair in his bedroom, even though Spike claims he wouldn't want to bite him even if he could. Spike begins an exaggerated imitation of Anya to annoy Xander. Olivia shows up at Giles' apartment, and after some brief talking they get right to kissing. At the clock tower, one of the Gentlemen opens a box, and the voices of all the people in Sunnydale float out of their mouths and are drawn into the box. When Buffy and Willow wake up the next morning and find they have no voices, they panic. Leaving their room, they see that nobody else in the dorms can speak, either. Xander, similarly panicked, blames Spike, whose gestured response is very clear. Riley and Forrest try to enter the underground lab, but without his voice Riley cannot activate the voice-based security system on the elevator door. Riley open a security panel and tries to put in a security code but gets it wrong several times. When the elevator opens they are cowed when Professor Walsh points out a sign saying they should have used the stairs in the event of emergencies.||||| Tara shows up at Stevenson hall looking around for Willow. A boy drops a glass and everyone jumps at the noise. When she doesn't see Willow she leaves. Buffy and Willow walk through the town, they see that Sunnydale is closed down -- except for bars and liquor stores. A doomsayer silently preaches it's the end of the world. People are sitting in random places, all sadly giving up or just stunned. They see someone selling dry erase boards for $10, at which Buffy rolls her eyes. Still they show up at Giles place armed with dry-erase boards hanging from their necks. A television news report states that everyone in Sunnydale has come down with a case of laryngitis and the town has been quarantined.||||| The threat of chaos looming that night, Buffy goes out to patrol, and Professor Walsh sends Riley and his team out incognito to maintain order. Riley and Buffy meet while walking out on the streets and as Riley is about to leave, he turns and kisses Buffy for the first time. Later that night, the Gentlemen and their demonic footmen lurk out into the night. Olivia wakes up in the middle of the night, and through the window she spies one of the Gentlemen, who travel by floating a foot in the air with their demon assistants, the Footmen , following on the ground. Two Gentlemen float through the UC Sunnydale dorms, finding a freshman boy. Their demon assistants hold the boy down while they cut out his heart. The next morning, Olivia draws a picture of the creature she saw. Giles sees in the paper that there was another similar murder the previous night and and recognizes what is happening. He puts aside his demonic volumes and pulls out a book: Fairy Tales .||||| In a lecture room at the college, Giles tells the story of the Gentlemen through very disturbing drawings and text on an overhead projector, with musical embellishment. Anya pulls out a bag of popcorn as they watch. Giles story tells how they travel into a town to collect seven human hearts, and they collect all the voices so that no-one can scream as a human voice is the only thing that can kill them.||||| Buffy mimes killing them with a stake and when they all look at her strangely she pulls out an actual stake and make the same miming motion. However Giles puts a sign up on the projector that they are immune to weaponry such as swords and stakes , in the tales \"The Princess screamed once, and they all died.\" Only the sound of a real human voice -- not a recorded one, despite Willow's suggestion -- can kill them and they have collected at least two of the seven human hearts they need. Unfortunately, Giles does not know how to get everyone's voices back, so has everyone else research. Giles puts up and image of Buffy on the projector, to which Buffy takes offence because it's hips are so wide. Despite that, it says she'll patrol. Riley and the rest of the Initiative suits up and then prepares to do the same.||||| Tara from the Wicca group tries to get to Willow's dorm when the Gentlemen chase after her. She finally makes it to Willow's dorm, and the two girls make a run for it. Riley is attacked by several of the Gentlemen's footmen in the clock tower, until Buffy shows up and starts fighting alongside him. The two are first shocked to see each other, but have neither time nor the ability to speak about it. Spike vamps out while drinking a mug of blood at Giles' house; as he bends down by the sofa on which Anya is sleeping, Xander sees blood on Spike's lip and the unconscious Anya and concludes Spike has bitten Anya. Xander punches Spike several times before Anya and Giles stop him. He then kisses her passionately, and, realizing he does indeed love her, Anya suggests, through not very subtle hand signals, that they have sex and the two quickly rush off.||||| Hiding in a laundry room, Willow and Tara try to push a vending machine against the door to block it, but due to Willows hurt ankle that she got when Tara accidently ran into her, they're not strong enough. Willow then tries to move it using magic, but she can only shake it a bit. Tara understands what she's trying to do, and clasps Willow's hand so they can combine their power. As soon as they hold hands, the vending machine slams against the door. Buffy gets caught by the Igor-like Footmen and the Gentlemen are about to cut into her when Riley shoots them with bolts of electricity. They fight and one of the demons grabs Buffy as she spots the box of voices on the table and recognizes it from her dream.||||| She points it out to Riley and, with great flair he smashes one of the vials sitting there. Buffy rolls her eyes and continues miming and he finally understands and smashes the box. Everyone's voice is returned, and Buffy lets out a loud and long scream, which causes the Gentlemen's heads to explode in a shower of green slime. The next day, Tara tells Willow that she was looking for her as she wanted to try a spell to restore the voices, knowing from the Wicca group that she was the only other person genuinely interested in it. The two talk, and Tara tells Willow that she's powerful, even if she doesn't know it yet. Giles and Olivia talk about how many scary things there really are and her reluctance to be part of Giles' world. In her dorm room, Buffy is visited by Riley. He tells her that they need to talk, and Buffy agrees. The two find themselves, once again, overcome by silence.","summary":"During a college lecture where Dr. Maggie Walsh is discussing the difference between language and communication, Buffy has a dream in which Riley kisses her. They are interrupted by a young girl holding a distinctive box, singing a cryptic rhyme about \"The Gentlemen\". Riley and Buffy speak after class and they almost kiss, but are unable to stop talking. They leave when it becomes awkward. Buffy calls Giles to tell him of her dream and the details of the little girl's rhyme. At Giles' apartment Xander and Anya argue, as Anya is trying to get Xander to tell her what she means to him. He is unable to answer her. Willow attends a meeting of the campus Wicca group, hoping to meet others who share her interest in studying witchcraft, but is disappointed when they only talk about bake sales. Willow raises the subject of spells but is chastised for pandering to the stereotype about witches performing magic. A shy woman in the group, Tara Maclay, starts to speak up to support Willow's suggestion, but falls silent when the attention turns to her. That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float from each person's mouth to a belfry, where they settle in the box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish skeletal figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover they are unable to speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts. The next night, the ghouls leave the belfry and float into town accompanied by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They knock on the door of a student. When he opens it, roused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice. That evening, Anya falls asleep on Giles' sofa while Spike takes a mugful of blood from the refrigerator. Xander enters Giles' apartment as Spike, his mouth wet with blood, bends down to pick up something that he dropped in front of the sofa where Anya sleeps. Inferring that Spike bit and drank from Anya, Xander pummels him ferociously until Anya wakes and stops him; excited that he fought to defend her, Anya gestures that they should go have sex. On her own, Tara finds a spell to help the town get its voices back, and goes out to show it to Willow. On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen floating toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking down the hall and exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door. On patrol, Riley notices shadows in the belfry and goes to investigate. Buffy finds two of The Gentlemen's minions, kills one and runs after the other. Riley fights his way into the belfry and while he's embattled, Buffy crashes through a window, fighting. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with Buffy. She fights while he stares, unmoving. When a minion pins her down she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates wildly for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. With her voice returned, Buffy screams until the heads of The Gentlemen and their minions explode. The next day, Tara tells Willow she is special and has significant power. Riley comes to visit Buffy in her dorm room and they sit facing each other, saying nothing."}
{"id":"ffcd1378250fdb4bd578a9c41afc3007","document":"The opening scene depicts Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfriend), a violent inmate in a correctional facility. She is notorious for being a 'kicker', and is now reflecting during lockdown on past events. Needy is a nerdy, substantially unpopular, \"plain Jane\" type student from Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, who has been best friends with Jennifer Check (Megan Fox), a beautiful, popular cheerleader, since their childhood. Needy's feelings toward Jennifer border on attraction. One evening, Jennifer has Needy accompany her to Melody Lane, a local bar, where an indie rock band named Low Shoulder is playing.||||| It seems unlikely that they would bother to perform in such a small town, but frontman Nikolai Wolf (Adam Brody) explains that it is a service to their fans. As Jennifer is fetching them drinks (getting past the age restriction barrier by flirting with the bartender), Needy overhears Nikolai referring to her as the \"State Fair Butter Queen\" - she loves to flirt and act promiscuously, but is in truth a virgin. During the performance, the bar catches on fire. Nikolai gazes on with a smirk, and Needy leads Jennifer to safety through the toilet window, just barely escaping from being killed in the blaze. Outside, they are accosted by the band, who made it out okay. Jennifer is in shock and Nikolai offers to lead them to \"somewhere safe\" in his van. Jennifer agrees in spite of Needy's protests and leaves with the band. Needy watches as the remains of the bar collapses to the ground.||||| Needy eventually makes it home where she finds a note from her divorced mother, stating that she is working swing shift this evening. Needy calls her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) to tell him what happened, and expresses her concern for Jennifer's safety. A bruised, bleeding Jennifer suddenly appears in Needy's home with torn clothing. Things get even stranger as Needy watches Jennifer tear wolfishly into a raw chicken in her fridge and monstrously roar at her, before spewing up a black, tar-like substance all over the floor. Jennifer further terrorizes Needy when she throws her against a wall and asks if she is scared of her. Jennifer then runs out the front door leaving a bewildered and frightened Needy behind.||||| The next day, the whole town mourns the tragedy of the bar fire, and Needy morosely remembers her childhood friend. Jennifer arrives at school acting as if nothing is wrong, and is completely unsympathetic to the victims of the fire. Jennifer meets up with the high school football captain, grieving the death of his best friend at the hands of the fire. She says his late friend suggested that they would have made a \"banging\" couple and leads him into the woods to ostensibly fulfill that request. As the two are kissing, her mouth transforms into a demonic gaping maw and she attacks him. Later that day, a highly-concerned teacher at the school finds the captain's grisly remains, and the town is rocked by the additional tragedy. Low Shoulder's song \"Through the Trees\" becomes a smashing success, and they donate 3% of their earnings to the cause of the victims. Needy questions the paltry effort, and wonders why they are credited with having rescued survivors while she herself knows that that is untrue.||||| A month passes by and Jennifer begins to look a little pale and gaunt, enigmatically explaining that \"it is wearing off\" and that she needs sustenance. Jennifer catches the eye of the school nerd Colin Gray (Kyle Gallner), and asks him to meet her at her house, though later making rude remarks to Needy about Colin's femininity and taste in music.||||| The next evening, Needy spends time with Chip, while Colin goes to meet Jennifer only to find that she has directed him to a still-in-construction house in a deserted neighborhood where she is in an upstairs room lit by various candles. Jennifer suddenly transforms into a snake-eyed humanoid creature, kills Colin, and sups on his flesh, as Needy has a vision of Jennifer that causes her to panic as Chip makes love to her. Needy drives home from Chip's house only to encounter Jennifer walking like an animal across the road before jumping onto her car's windshield. Needy returns home, only to find Jennifer sleeping in her bed and wearing one of Needy's shirts. They begin to passionately kiss until Needy snaps and demands to know what's happening. Needy orders Jennifer to leave, but Jennifer instead confesses what happened to her on the night the local bar burned down.||||| In a flashback sequence, Low Shoulder drove Jennifer out into a forested area, gleefully intending to offer her as a Satanic sacrifice in exchange for chart success. During the band's discussions, several wondered if Jennifer really was a virgin, which she insisted she was in the hopes that they would let her go. Using some instructions they downloaded off the internet, they spoke an incantation to the Devil, before stabbing her with a Bowie knife, which was then thrown into the notorious whirlpool off the nearby Devil's Kettle Falls.||||| Back in the present, Jennifer further explains to Needy that she found herself still alive (which Needy doubts), and then wandered away from the site after they had left, which is when Jennifer stumbled back to Needy's place that night. Jennifer also confides to Needy that when she is fully replenished with human flesh, she is indestructible. She demonstrates this by stabbing herself in the arm with a pocket knife, which immediately heals. Jennifer also tells Needy that on that same night, she came across the Indian exchange student that had survived the fire walking along the road, and devoured him and hid his body in the woods. Needy threatens to call the police, but Jennifer tells Needy that she will just deny everything and that no one will ever believe such a story. With that, Jennifer jumps out of Needy's second floor window and lands on the ground, completely uninjured, and runs off into the night.||||| Now more worried than ever, Needy goes to the occult section of their school's library and begins to do research. Needy soon finds where the band went wrong. Because Jennifer wasn't actually means a virgin, their sacrifice backfired - though it indeed brought them prosperity, it also turned Jennifer into a succubus, a female demon with a constant need to feed on young men to keep herself in good health. Needy realizes that the Spring Formal is approaching and that Jennifer could very well turn the dance into a bloodbath. She informs Chip about this and warns him not to attend the Formal, but he simply suggests that she get psychiatric help.||||| She breaks up with him in order to protect him, and he decides to attend in lieu of her warnings. The Spring Formal finally arrives, attended by Low Shoulder, who are now incredibly popular and have sold out a national tour. As they take the stage, Needy does not see Chip anywhere, so she leaves in pursuit of him. In the meanwhile, Jennifer confronts Chip in the woods, telling him that Needy was having an affair with Colin and that that was why she was so upset when the latter passed. Despite Chip affirming that he loves Needy, Jennifer kisses him ardently in an attempt to seduce him. She leads him to an abandoned mansion with a graffiti-filled indoor swimming pool. She kisses him again, but he rejects her yet again, causing her to throw him into the gunky water in a fit of rage.||||| Needy rushes towards the mansion to find a demonic, animalistic Jennifer and an injured Chip, still in the pool and suffering extensive blood loss due to Jennifer already having bitten him. Needy dives into the water to help Chip and maces Jennifer, causing her to vomit more black fluid. As Needy and Chip crawl out of the dirty swimming pool, Jennifer levitates above them. Needy confronts Jennifer about how she was never a good friend to her, and Jennifer threatens to kill her. Chip, uses the last of his energy to impale Jennifer through the stomach with a pool net's handle, before she escapes through a nearby window. Needy tries to call for help using Chip's phone, but it is damaged from being in the water. He dies in her arms, but not before the two profess their mutual love.||||| Needy wails as she mourns him. Needy, hell-bent on revenge, breaks into Jennifer's room, where she and her former best friend scuffle. Needy eventually yanks the \"Best Friends Forever\" locket from her former friend's neck and kills her by stabbing her through the heart with a box cutter. Jennifer's mother (Carrie Genzel) hears the noise and enters the bedroom to find Needy crouched over her daughter with the bloody knife. This results in Needy being taken to a mental institution. However, due to having been bitten by Jennifer during their fight, Needy has developed some demonic powers of her own, as well as Jennifer's evil personality - she has become vicious, ill-tempered, and anti-social with the orderlies and other residents. Isolated and abandoned by everyone she knows, she sets a plot in motion to escape. After a fight with an institution doctor, Needy is isolated in a cell. That night, she levitates herself to an overhead window, kicks it out with her superhuman strength, breaks through a nearby chain-link fence, and escapes into the night.||||| As she wanders down a rural road, she finds a watery runoff (which is where the nearby Devil Falls empties out into), along with the knife that Low Shoulder used to stab Jennifer, which she picks up. She flags down a passing vehicle and tells the driver she's following a band. The man exclaims that they must \"be one hell of a group,\" to which she then grimly explains that \"tonight's gonna be their last show.\" The end credits show Low Shoulder checking into a hotel post-concert and candidly indulging in drugs and alcohol in their hotel room. Eventually, the band is savagely murdered by a blurred figure. We then see police crime scene photos of the band members' corpses strewn around the hotel room, Nikolai having been stabbed in the chest with the sacrificial knife. The final image of the movie shows security camera footage of an evil-looking Needy walking down the hotel hallway past a gathering of female band groupies.","summary":"Anita \"Needy\" Lesnicki, once an insecure and studious teenager living near Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, is now a violent mental inmate who narrates the story as a flashback while in solitary confinement. Since childhood, she had been friends with Jennifer Check, a popular cheerleader, despite having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by indie rock band Low Shoulder. A suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. In shock, Jennifer agrees to leave with the band, despite Needy's protests. Later that evening, Jennifer, covered in blood, appears in Needy's kitchen and attempts to eat food from the refrigerator. She immediately vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid and leaves in a hurry.\n\nThe next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and dismisses Needy's concerns. While the town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire, Jennifer seduces the school's football captain in the woods and disembowels him. Meanwhile, the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their falsely-rumored heroism during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.\n\nA month later, Jennifer appears sick and listless. She accepts a date with school alternative/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and her boyfriend Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she again encounters Jennifer, who explains that Low Shoulder had taken her into the woods after the bar fire and offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not actually a virgin, so she became permanently possessed. Leaving the woods, Jennifer had encountered an exchange student leaving the scene of the fire and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, healing instantly.\n\nThe following day, Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus who must feed on flesh and can only be killed while she is hungry and weak. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries about Jennifer and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him in order to protect him. Chip decides to attend the dance anyway but is intercepted by Jennifer, who takes him to an abandoned pool house and begins feeding on him. Needy arrives there and fights Jennifer. Chip impales Jennifer through the stomach with a pool skimmer, but Jennifer removes it and escapes, while Chip dies.\n\nNeedy goes to Jennifer's home and breaks into her bedroom. She fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart with a utility knife, killing her and destroying the demon. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy on top of her daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. In her asylum room, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as super strength and the ability to levitate, due to a non-fatal bite from Jennifer during the fight between them.

He is 76 and rich, and Genevieve lied to him saying that she's 39. Zoila wonders if the man is stupid to think that this is her employer's real age, but then he enters the house, revealing himself to be blind. The maids aren't comfortable maintaining the lie over dinner, especially when Alfred announces that Genevieve has agreed to bear him a child, and Zoila asks her how that's supposed to work. Genevieve reveals that she'll pretend to find out she's barren and then adopt an orphan, but Zoila doesn't like the idea of a kid being brought into this.||||| Genevieve believes herself to be a wonderful mother, but this is only because nobody's told her that Remi is really in rehab, and Valentina stops her mother from doing so when she almost throws this in Genevieve's face.||||| Valentina assures that Alfred is smart and will figure out Genevieve's lies when he wants to, but Zoila accidentally spills the beans when she reveals that Genevieve's father died during the Korean war in the 50s, and Alfred demands to know his fiancee's real age. Once he does, he leaves her, and Zoila tries apologizing to her boss but points out that it's for the best because Genevieve was lying about being in love with him anyway. However, Genevieve assures that she liked Alfred for more than just his money, while Valentina tends to the old man as he prepares to move out. She gives her candid opinion that perhaps the reason that Alfred is so unwilling to forgive Genevieve is the reason that he's 76 and never been married, which gets Alfred thinking: he's willing to stay with Genevieve if they can use a surrogate to bear them a child... but he wants to use Valentina's eggs to make the baby.||||| Rosie meets with Marisol to learn the schematics of the Powell house before going to work there, with Marisol lying to the other maids and saying that Rosie is doing extra work with her over at the Stappords'.

Lavi, however, realises that the whole thing is an illusion and that he needs to get out of there. Meanwhile, despite her injured legs, Lenalee tries to get out of Road's barrier by kicking it over and over again. She eventually becomes exhausted, but Chaozii, having seen her determination begins to punch the barrier in an attempt to break it down. Lenalee tries to stop him but he does not listen, even when his fist begins to bleed. Unsurprisingly, he is unable to break down the barrier and despairs at his lack of power.||||| As this happens, Road and Tyki look to Allen in shock when they see that he has produced a sword from his left arm. Allen is determined to get out of there by using his new power, managing to push back a surprised Tyki, who begins to worry he has awakened something terrible. Road also expresses shock upon seeing the sword, which she remembers as one the Millennium Earl once held. Even Lenalee becomes concerned about the large amount of power coming from Allen. With this, Allen continues his fight with Tyki, asking him is there is anyone in the world he would want to protect. This makes Tyki think back to his human friends, especially Eeez , who he often gave gifts of small, precious stones and the silver buttons from the exorcist uniforms. Road reveals that she knows why he always takes the silver buttons from the slayed exorcists' uniforms and tells Tyki that he seems to be getting too friendly with the humans he hangs out with.||||| Despite thinking about the group of humans he cares for, Tyki maintains that there are times when the people he wants to protect do not matter - he greatly enjoys killing and destroying. At that moment, Allen strikes him with his Sword of Exorcism, and although Tyki felt the pain, he realises it did not kill him like he thought it would. Tyki is not completely unharmed, however, as it is revealed by Allen that he did not strike his body, but his Noah memories. When Allen prepares to deal the finishing blow to Tyki's Noah memories, Road leaps into action but Tyki stops her. He thinks about what it would be like if one of the sides of him were to disappear - he considers it will actually make life easier, but concludes that it would probably be boring. He stands, and allows Allen to stab him, apologising to Road. He again thinks of Eeez before he passes out.||||| While Chaozii celebrates their win, Road becomes enraged and stabs him with her sharpened candles. She then summons more of the candles to surround Allen, Lenalee and Chaozii, and although she realises that they would probably do no harm to Allen, the others would surely die if they were struck. Road heads to Tyki's body and holds him, warning Allen that she feels a little hot-headed because of what happened. She wishes to punish his friends for what happened, promising to rip Lavi's heart to shreds. Back in the dream world, Lavi is surrounded by the illusions of his friends' reanimated corpses. He is again confronted by Bookman who asks him what the duty of the Bookman Clan is. At that moment, Lenalee awakens in Lavi's arms and attempts to stab him, though Lavi manages to jump back in time. She asks him why he has abandoned his friends, and tells him that they are not just ink on paper. With this, all of his friends begin to attack him. Lavi closes his eyes and reminds himself that it is all an illusion. He attempts to calm himself, then begins to fight back.","summary":"Allen continues his attack on Tyki after reaching critical point , with Lenalee and Chaozii being able to do nothing but watch. It is not long before Allen is able to use his newly acquired Sword of Exorcism to destroy Tyki's Noah memories, which enrages Road .\n\nMeanwhile, Lavi struggles in Road's Dream World when he is confronted by illusions of his friends, Bookman and his 48th alias, Deak."}

The brothers haven't spoken since Damon left Stefan on the train platform in WWII. Joe stabs Damon with a vervain needle, saying the money was too good to pass up. Damon manages to stab Joe in the neck with his broken glass before he drops. Another man comes in and says he'll be Damon's doctor from now on. In the present, Damon wakes up in a cell with Wes Maxfield injecting him with vervain. He tells Damon that because he killed his test subject last night (Jesse), Damon's going to take his place. Elena takes Aaron's help to find Damon At college, Elena drops in on Aaron, who is reeling over the death of his roommate, Jesse.||||| Even though Elena killed him, she pretends to be shocked. Aaron is overwhelmed by the fact that someone else close to him died. She asks about Wes, who became his legal guardian after his aunt Sarah died. She tells Aaron that Damon went to talk to Wes last night and no one has seen either of them since. She asks for his help finding Wes. Aaron thinks he knows a place. Elena asks Aaron if he thinks it's weird that both his friends committed suicide in their first semester. Elena tells Aaron that Wes covered up Megan's murder. Aaron wants to find Wes to ask him about it. He takes Elena to the Whitmore House, which she knows she can't enter. But Wes invites her in and she's able to enter. He confesses that he owns the house as part of the Whitmore Trust he inherited when his parents died. His name's Aaron Whitmore. Elena looks at a picture and recognizes her father. Wes joins them, and says Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors the Augustines ever had. Then he injects Elena with vervain.||||| Caroline makes Stefan go inside the safe to overcome his PTSD At the house, Stefan keeps watch over Katherine, trying to ensure she doesn't kill herself. She's pouty and angry about his hovering and thinks he can't help her until he deals with his own PTSD. She called in help. Caroline arrives as his sober coach--with a giant safe. Stefan questions whether the safe is a good idea for coping with his PTSD. Caroline reads up on PTSD while Stefan is in the safe. She's oblivious as Stefan starts to freak out inside. Outside, Katherine wonders how you help the guy who is always the hero for everyone else. She gets an idea.||||| Damon being experimented and tortured in 1953 by the Augustine society\n\nWes checks in on Damon in his cell. Damon remembers the last time he was locked up, by Dr. Whitmore. Flash back to 1953, Whitmore has Damon strapped to a table. He plans to experiment on him, knowing that as a vampire he'll heal from all his wounds. He plans to cut out parts of Damon's internal organs so he'll regrow them. To begin, he stabs Damon in the eye. Maxfield tells Damon that after training Jesse to crave vampire blood, he's ready to take his research to his next level. Aaron struggles to understand what Wes is doing. Wes tells him vampires exist and Elena is one of them. He opens his safe to reveal stacks of Whitmore files. Wes explains to Aaron that his father taught him everything he knows about vampires and research and the Whitmore Trust has been funding his research. He tells Aaron it's his legacy.||||| Wes captures Elena too\n\nElena wakes up in a cell next to Damon. Damon confesses he's been there before and tells her about Whitmore's torture, including cutting up pieces of them every day. He was there for about five years. He made a friend, Enzo, a soldier in Europe during WWII, who was also a vampire. Whitmore was working in a battlefield hospital overseas when he discovered Enzo was a vampire and locked him in a coffin and shipped him overseas. He'd been locked up ten years. Enzo tried to teach Damon how to survive, including picturing exactly how he'd get his revenge. Elena tells Damon that her dad worked with Whitmore and was an Augustine. She doesn't want to believe he'd be part of a place that would cut Damon's eyes out. Damon tells Elena about his friend Enzo who was also tortured along with him\n\n1953 Enzo keeps Damon going by talking to him about a girl named Maggie that he liked.||||| Whitmore interrupts, asking who's next. He goes for Damon, but Enzo volunteers. Damon listens to him scream from in his cell until he's finally brought back in a bloody heap. Damon asks Whitmore why he's doing this and he explains he's trying to understand vampires on a cellular level to make use of them. Back in the present, Elena thinks Stefan will figure it out and come rescue them, but Damon never told him he was locked up--he didn't want to give him more to feel guilty about. Damon explains how he escaped.||||| They let the vampires out once a year for the Augustine's New Year's Eve party to show them off. They were weak from vervain and captivity. Whitmore demonstrates vampire blood's healing powers, using Mrs. Fell as a volunteer. She drinks vampire blood to heal her hand after he cuts it. Enzo comes up with a plan, suggesting one of them drink both of their daily rations of blood for a year so that when they're let out next New Year's Eve, one of them will have the strength to fight. They play rock paper scissors and Damon wins. Elena wants to know what happened, but Damon is not forthcoming with the details, saying only that it wasn't pretty.||||| Aaron learns that his family was killed by a vampire\n\nWes gives Aaron his grandfather's watch, which he says is a precaution against vampires. Aaron sees news clips about his parents' death at a campground. Wes admits they were killed by vampires. Aaron decks Wes, knocking him to the ground. He takes the gun and bullets from the safe and the watch. Back in the safe, Stefan wakes up next to Katherine. She knows he gets anxious and violent when his PTSD kicks in. She also knows he wants to keep her alive, so she's counting on him not hurting her.||||| Damon turns off his humanity as he leaves Enzo to die in the fire\n\nDown in the cell, Elena prods Damon to tell her how he escaped. In 1958, he'd been drinking Enzo's rations for a year and he'd gotten stronger. When Whitmore opened the cage to take Damon out to show him off to the guests on New Year's, Damon broke his own hand to slip out of the chains. He gouged Whitmore's eyes out, then attacked as many people as he could in the room, knocking over a candelabra as he went. The fire raged with Enzo still in the cage. Damon tried to free him, but the bars were coated in vervain and the fire was advancing. Finally, he chose to save himself, but he turned off his emotions first so he could leave Enzo behind. He left Enzo there to die in the fire.||||| Caroline hugs Stefan after he is successful in dealing with his PTSD\n\nBack at the house, in the safe Stefan hyperventilates, saying he feels like he's dying. Katherine tells Stefan she believes there is something to the doppelganger prophecy and Stefan wants to get far away from Damon and Elena and she's just the latest excuse to stay in town. Stefan starts choking her. She tells him she thinks he's choosing to focus on the physical pain of drowning in the safe instead of the emotional pain of Elena breaking his heart. She turns to offer Stefan her neck and urges him to fight it. She promises she's there with him.||||| They are dangerously close to kissing when Caroline opens the safe, worried about how quiet it got. Out of the safe, Stefan seems to look at Katherine differently. Aaron shoots Damon after he confesses that he was the one who killed Aaron's family\n\nAaron comes down to the cells in the basement with his gun. He accuses Elena of killing Megan and possibly of killing his parents. Damon stops him, and says it was him. Damon explains that with Enzo dead, he had to carry out his revenge plan himself. He planned to kill all the Whitmores in a generation, except one, then let him grow up and start a family, and then kill all of them except one, and so on. And he did.||||| Elena is disgusted and asks when the last one was. A few months ago, Sarah in Charleston. It was a weekend trip. Elena realizes they were together then. Aaron shoots Damon. Stefan and Katherine kiss\n\nBack at the house, Stefan tells Katherine he was right. He admits she knew what she was doing, and she admits sometimes she doesn't even know. She slides up close to him and runs her hands across his chest. She kisses him. He kisses her back. Caroline leaves Elena a message, saying she's going to stay at her mom's. She hears Stefan and Katherine making out and tells her to call. Elena meets Enzo and is shocked to find him alive\n\nBack in his dorm room, Aaron calls Wes, angry about having been lied to his whole life. Wes tells him to live his life. Damon wakes up from his head wound in his cell. Elena is gone. Elena wakes up strapped to an exam table next to another vampire. He introduces himself. \"My name is Enzo,\" he says.","summary":"Flashback to the 1953, Damon is vervained. As Damon is caged in the present, Wes reveals his plans to use him as his next test object.

Caroline brings the safe Stefan spend three months under water in, so he could deal with his problems. Wes is forced to vervain Elena and reveal the truth about vampires to Aaron in order to secure him. When Elena is trapped by Wes in a cage she meets Damon, who tells her about The Whittemore family and how he survived. Damon reveals to Elena that with him was a man named Enzo. Katherine comes up with the perfect idea that can help Stefan move on from his fear from the safe: Katherine got into the safe with him. While Katherine works with Stefan through his real problem, Elena dumping him, Damon shares his past to Elena. Enzo and Damon had come up with a plan to escape. Enzo gave Damon his daily ration of blood for a year and then at a party, Damon attacked the rest of the humans at the party. A candle set the place on fire and Damon abandoned Enzo to die. Aaron confronts Elena about his family's deaths, and Damon reveals that as a part of his revenge, he killed all of the Whitmore family except one, preferring to wait for more generations to be born so he could continue his revenge.

At FBI HQ in Boston Charlie ( Kirk Acevedo ), Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) and Olivia ( Anna Torv ) watch the security footage from Nina's building. There are three of them, wearing masks. They shoot her in the elevator then the tape cuts out for four minutes. They try to match the voice. David Robert Jones ( Jared Harris ), the ZFT mastermind. He says \"take out the camera, we can do it here.\" Olivia wants to bring William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) in. Broyles gently chastises her for assuming he doesn't agree. He's on board. Nina Sharp is out of surgery. Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) comes in to the lab. Walter ( John Noble ) didn't come home last night. Peter calls someone about Walter. Astrid ( Jasika Nicole ) can't find him either. Peter tells Olivia he understands why she had to say what she did. He's not worried about him.||||| Walter visits a grave, The Observer ( Michael Cerveris ) watches. Nina wakes up. Her electronic hand is on the fritz. Broyles is at her bedside. He asks her what Jones wanted with her arm. Nina asks for Olivia. Jones walks down a street carrying a briefcase, face partially bandaged. Olivia comes to Nina's room where specialists from Massive Dynamic are working on her. Jones and his crew start setting something up in the middle of a busy street. Nina tells Olivia that Jones worked for Bell 15 years ago but Bell isn't a terrorist. She says Jones was fired and was bitter about it since William was a father figure to him. She said after Jones busted out of prison he started calling for Bell a lot. Broyles tells Olivia that Nina thinks Jones wants to kill Bell. But she doesn't know where he is. She hasn't seen Bell for months. She thinks speaking to Bell has become more than a professional matter. She's counting on it. If Olivia can get to Jones first, she can talk to Bell.||||| Olivia asks what Jones did to Nina in the elevator after she was shot. Holding her bionic arm, she says Jones stole a very powerful energy cell Bell hid there. Jones delicately takes a small object out of a case and fits it into his machine. Through his bandages his face is bubbly and gross. The machine starts emitting a high pitched whine. People on the street start holding their ears. They increase the frequency. As Jones turns some knobs a whirring energy field appears in the street, like some sort of wormhole. Jones' men tell him they can't hold it open and it shuts, cutting off the back half of a truck that passed through. Jones says they're the wrong coordinates and they need to try again. When he removes his sunglasses we can see one of his eyes is now blue. Walter and The Observer walk along a beach. The Observer asks Walter if he recognizes a coin he's holding. Walter asks him how he got it. He says it looks similar to one Walter is thinking of, but it's different. \"There's more than one of everything,\" he says.||||| He asks him if the house they're in front of looks familiar and if he remembers what he has to find. He says there isn't much time. At Harvard, Broyles brings Nina into the lab. They ask her if Walter talked to anyone strange lately. Nina tells Peter that Jones has something Walter might know about. Nina calls someone for a search of Walter. Olivia and Charlie check out the half truck. Witnesses describe a curtain or window with a sheen that the truck came through. They describe a man in bandages. Nina shows Peter train security footage of his dad near a beach house they used to own. Peter wants to go up there himself. At the truck, Charlie gets a report the VIN and serial numbers don't exist and there's no record of it anywhere. Peter reaches the beach house. He looks around inside and finds Walter sitting by himself. He says he's looking for something. He's turning the coin over and over. He knows what he's looking for is important, but he can't remember what it is.||||| Olivia asks Nina where the truck came from. She asks where Bell is. She tells Nina to stop playing games or she'll turn this world over looking for him. Nina says that's the problem, he's not in this world. Providence, Rhode Island A black van pulls up to a kid's soccer game. Jones gets out. OIivia tries to talk Charlie through the idea Bell is in an alternate reality. That's why they can't ID the truck. It came from the other side. That's what Jones is using the energy cell for, to cross over to get to Bell. Their cell phones all ring. Walter searches frantically through the house, on the verge of a breakdown. Peter tries to calm him down, but he rails and thrashes and keeps searching. Peter tells his dad about fond memories of coming to the house as a kid, including Walter making pancakes. Walter gets excited when he remembers. He knows why he's there and where it is.||||| At the soccer field a kid describes a see-through wall that appeared, like a window. A kid ran into the shimmer and collapsed. They look at the body - it's cleanly sliced off. Charlie is ready to start buying the alternate reality theory. Olivia asks someone to run a check for all files mentioning science, biology or unexplained phenomena. All of them. She starts marking them on a map of New England with pushpins. She tells Broyles she thinks she found a connection and they need to call Nina. Walter opens a trunk in the beach house attic. He finds the box he was looking for with a coin just like the one The Observer gave him on top. It's a small tackle box, but it's locked. Olivia goes over the dots with Nina and Broyles. She marks the spots where Jones used his device. The other locations radiate out from them.||||| Walter opens the box and takes out a small object. He says when he and William were young they took copious amounts of LSD and became convinced they could experience alternate realities and some kids could see these alternate realities naturally. They theorized the subjects might be able to travel to alternate worlds. Around this time, Walter says, he lost something very dear to him. He thought he could find it over there. Nina explains finding the right place to cross over is the key. Bell proposed our world has \"soft spots,\" areas where the speed of light and protons have begun to decay, like the Bermuda Triangle, where it is easier to cross over. Their meddling with the laws of nature has increased the soft spots. She thinks Jones is looking for those. Walter continues the explanation, saying opening the hole could let things from there cross over to here, which could be dangerous. He built a plug, a patch to close the hole. That's what the object is. And he knows where the hole is: Reiden Lake.||||| Nina and Olivia want to try to predict the next soft spot. They trace the oldest incidents back to Reiden Lake. Jones and his men arrive at Reiden Lake. He tells them to set up the gear. \"Come on, men, we're going to the other side,\" he says. Peter drives Walter to the lake. Walter says they have to hurry, but he doesn't know why. He mentions his friend who visited him. Peter realizes he's talking about The Observer, the man who attacked him in the woods. Walter says Peter probably doesn't remember, but when he was very sick as a kid he began collecting coins to calm himself. He gives Peter the one he's been holding and says it was the coin. Peter doesn't remember it. Suddenly, their doors are opened and men grab them out of the car. Olivia runs over and calls off her agents. They're all there to plug a hole in the universe.||||| They see a bright light in the distance and run for it. Jones has got the machine going. He stays focused on it as his side starts trading gunfire with FBI agents. Walter gives Peter the patch to close the hole as Olivia creeps closer to Jones and the slowly opening universe hole. The hole opens up and Jones walks towards it. She shoots him. He keeps going. She shoots him again. He walks on. Looking oozy and gross, he tells her the teleporter may be killing him, but in the meantime it's made him something special. Bullets pass through him. He walks toward the opening. Olivia runs after him and Peter, holding the patch, runs after her. As Jones steps into the hole, Peter aims the patch at it, emitting a light. The hole closes shut, shearing Jones in half. Back at HQ Broyles tells OIivia that Nina sends her gratitude, but they've been told to cease and desist their investigation into William Bell.||||| Astrid arrives at the lab. She and Peter find a note, addressed to him. He reads it: \"Stepping out for a bit, don't worry about me, son, I know where I'm going.\" Peter tells Astrid not to call the police. It's the first time Walter's left a note. Walter stands back at the grave he visited earlier. He leaves the coin on it. It says: \"Peter Bishop, 1978-1985.\" Walter cries. Olivia's phone rings. It's Nina Sharp, summoning her to a hotel in Manhattan, planning to hold up her end of the bargain.||||| On her way there, through the city, Olivia is nearly hit by a speeding car. She makes it to the hotel as planned. She waits. She calls for Nina and is told Nina is out of the country. Olivia leaves. She rides the elevator down. She's alone. Then the lights flash and she's not, then she is again. The doors open on an all-white hallway. A woman greets her by name and shows her to an office. There is an oxygen tank and newspapers announcing Obama's victory. A man enters. \"I've been waiting quite a long time for this,\" he tells her. She asks where she is and who he is. The first part is complicated. The second is easy: He's William Bell. Olivia looks out the window.

Riley shows up at the hospital to comfort Buffy, who seems relieved to see him. She directs him to sit with Dawn in the waiting room while she talks to their mother. Joyce confesses to Buffy that the doctors have found a \"shadow\" in her CAT scan, and they need to do an initial operation to evaluate her condition, and to discover whether surgery is an option. At The Magic Box, the Scoobies continue to search for information that might indicate the origins, purpose, or weaknesses of Glory.||||| Tara suggests that maybe the Beast is something that is too old for the books, which Giles believes may explain the presence of the Dagon Sphere, which is to ward against that \"which cannot be named.\" They discuss the possibility that Glory may predate language itself, when she herself shows up there and buys several items for a spell. The gang is, of course, oblivious to her true identity, and she leaves the store without incident. Back at the hospital, the doctor tells Buffy her mother has a brain tumor and presents her with her mother's options. Ben, an intern, gets the doctor away from Buffy, giving her a break from the doctor's constant questions. Riley takes Dawn to the park, where he tries to comfort her about her mother.||||| Dawn tries to make Riley feel good by positively comparing him to Buffy's former boyfriend Angel, but unintentionally makes him feel worse: she relates that she thinks Riley is good for Buffy because Buffy was always in tears over her tumultuous relationship with Angel, but that she never cries over Riley - she never \"gets that worked up\" over him. The impact of this revelation is evident in his face - this is yet another way that he can see that Buffy has kept him at an emotional distance and that she feels no intensity in their relationship. Back at The Magic Shop, Buffy talks with the gang about the possibility of helping her mother through the use of magics.||||| However, while Willow expresses willingness to help if she can, Tara and Giles both insist that the magical and the medical are not meant to mix, and that any attempts they made to help Joyce would likely only make things worse. They encourage her to put her faith in the doctors. As Anya sorts through receipts at The Magic Shop, she realizes Giles had sold items needed for an ancient Sobekian transmogrification spell - a Kohl's amulet and a Sobekian bloodstone. The gang describes the Temple of Sobekian as an ancient Egyptian cult who worshipped reptiles and were \"heavy into dark magic\", but the Sobekian spells were thought to have been lost for centuries. Giles remembers to whom he sold the items and realizes that Glory had been to the shop and that she must have obtained the lost spell. Buffy takes off in search of Glory, despite the concerns of Giles and her friends that Glory will merely overpower her again.||||| At the Sunnydale Zoo, Glory steals a cobra and performs the spell with Dreg. Buffy arrives to stop her, temporarily interrupting the spell, but instead gets beaten up badly again. The cobra is transformed into a giant cobra monster with arms, and Glory sends the demon on a mission to locate the Key. Riley arrives at the magic shop in search of Buffy, but Xander confronts him about destroying the vampire crypt. The gang tells Riley that Buffy went after Glory, and he demands to know why they would let her do something so dangerous. Giles reminds Riley that \"let\" is not an issue when Buffy sets her mind to something.||||| Xander tells Riley that Buffy is so upset about the situation with her mom that she needs something tangible to fight, and then asks Riley what his excuse is for his own reckless actions. Buffy calls Giles from the hospital and tells him to take care of Dawn while she stays with her mother. She stays with her mother as the doctor tells her more bad news about Joyce's condition - she has a brain tumor, and they don't know yet if it is operable or not. Riley returns to Willy's bar to drink away his worries and again encounters the vampire Sandy. He allows her to bite him in the alley, but stakes her. The cobra demon arrives at the magic shop and goes after Dawn. Dawn screams in fear and the cobra retreats.||||| Realising that the cobra knows Dawn is the Key and is returning to inform Glory, Giles and Buffy go after the demon. Buffy catches up with it in a field near Glory's apartment and kills it, then lets out her pent-up frustration from her time at the hospital by continuing to beat up the lifeless cobra. Glory watches from a window, frustrated that her snake monster has failed to return in a timely manner. Joyce tells Dawn the truth about her health. Riley is there to comfort Buffy (wearing a turtleneck to hide his bite marks) but she refuses to accept comfort from him - she insists that she needs to stay strong for her family, refusing to cry. Joyce calls for Buffy and she turns and walks away, oblivious to his attempt to caress her face. Riley is left standing alone in the hallway, becoming increasingly frustrated with Buffy's inability or unwillingness to develop an emotional closeness with him, and to let herself be vulnerable around him.","summary":"Riley is looking for Buffy at her house, but all he finds is Spike in her room smelling her sweater. Spike informs Riley of Buffy's mom's illness and rubs it in his face that Buffy told the vampire about it before her own boyfriend. Riley goes to the hospital, and Buffy gives him plenty to do, like taking care of Dawn and patrolling, but what Riley really wants is to take care of Buffy. He ends up taking Dawn to an amusement park where they talk about a few things. Despite her good intentions, Dawn makes Riley feel like he's not good enough for Buffy and that he can't compare to Angel. Later on in the episode he feels even further away from being close to Buffy, and he goes and gets himself bitten by a vamp whore. Meanwhile, at the magic shop Giles accidentally sells two very bad, powerful ingredients for a spell to a \"young woman,\" who turns out to be the all powerful lady who creamed Buffy the last time they fought. Buffy tries to stop her again, but she's no match for the lady in"}

Bonnie leaves the room when Ross is seen, and after sharing a kiss with Rachel, Ross goes to break up with Bonnie.||||| When he returns to Rachel's room and informs her that he has ended his relationship with Bonnie and she has left, he is bemused to then learn that while he was doing this Rachel had written him a letter that is eighteen pages long, front and back. Understandably tired after breaking up with Bonnie, Ross falls asleep at the kitchen table reading the letter, and when he wakes up the next morning, he lies and claims that he has read the letter thoroughly and carefully when he has not finished it. Believing him, Rachel asks him \"Does it?\" Unsure of what she wants him to say, Ross takes a guess and says \"It does.\" It immediately becomes clear that this is exactly what Rachel was hoping he would say - she is overjoyed and they get back together. When he later gets a chance to actually read the letter however, he discovers that Rachel wants him to take full responsibility for all that went wrong in their relationship, and is outraged.||||| At the beach, Monica and Chandler are still debating why he should be her boyfriend, when she gets stung by a jellyfish.

This results in Chandler emerging from behind the front door and exclaiming, \"I knew it!\" (Chandler would have a similar erectile dysfunction on his engagement night.) The credits scene shows Monica and Chandler playing gin rummy.

The latest film Cecilia sees is a fictitious RKO Radio Pictures film, The Purple Rose of Cairo. It is the story of a rich Manhattan playwright named Henry (Edward Herrmann) who goes on an exotic vacation to Egypt with companions Jason (John Wood) and Rita (Deborah Rush). While in Egypt, the three meet archaeologist Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels).||||| Tom is brought back for a \"madcap Manhattan weekend\" where he falls head-over-heels for Kitty Haynes (Karen Akers), a chanteuse at the Copacabana. After Cecilia sits through the film several times, Tom, noticing her, breaks the fourth wall, and emerges from the inner film's black-and-white world into the full color real world the other side of the cinema screen. He tells Cecilia that he is attracted to her after noticing her watching him so many times, and she takes him around her New Jersey town. Later, he takes her into the film and they have a great evening on the town within the film. The two fall in love. But the character's defection from the film has caused some problems. In other copies of the film, others have tried to exit the screen.||||| The producer of the film learns that Tom has left the film, and he flies cross-country to New Jersey with actor Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels) (the \"real life\" actor playing the part of Tom in the movie).

Gil abandons Cecilia and is seen quietly racked with guilt on his flight back to Hollywood. Having been left without a lover, job, or home, Cecilia ends up immersing herself in the frothy escapism of Hollywood once again.

{"id":"58056592c024a251fed8ccd9d8bf60a6","document":"Elwood P. Dowd is an endlessly pleasant and delightfully eccentric bachelor living in a small town that isn't quite aware that its newest citizen is a invisible, 6'3\" white rabbit named \"Harvey,\" that only certain people can see. After supposedly meeting this rabbit - its origins attributed to the Celtic legend of the Pooka - Dowd's sanity is put into question by his equally eccentric sister, Veta Louise. Elwood casually drives his sister's guests from their house by introducing and carrying on one-sided conversations with his invisible and silent friend. His sister and niece, Myrtle Mae, resort to taking him to the local sanitarium to have him committed. However, owing to people not paying attention, interrupting, and cutting Elwood off as he is about to introduce his imaginary friend, it doesn't immediately appear that there is anything wrong with him, although the examining doctor is sure he is doing the right thing by admitting him.||||| Elwood is carted upstairs by a rough-handed and simple-minded man in the white coat while the examining doctor ushers the sister into the head psychiatrist's --Dr. Chumley's-- office to give a description of the problem. As Elwood is \"escorted\" to hydrotherapy, he tells the man in the white coat his friend \"Harvey\" is a \"Pooka\"||||| The Aide later looks up the definition in the dictionary: \"Celtic mythology, a mischievous spirit that takes animal form and appears sometimes to some people for the purpose of doing this and that.\" As Veta, still highly upset over Elwood driving away her friends, bemoans Elwoods delusions to Dr. Chumley, her frazzled manner and insistence that Elwood actually does have a six foot 3 inch invisible rabbit for a friend convinces Chumley it is she, not Elwood, who is hallucinating. He quickly has Veta carted upstairs and, fearing a lawsuit for incarcerating and treating a sane man, brings Elwood down and makes every manner of friendly gesture, including firing the examining doctor, Dr. Sanderson . His nurse, Miss Kelly, who is actually quite fond of Dr. Sanderson, is crestfallen, but, upset at being fired, the good doctor is unaware of her feelings for him, and this angers her.||||| Elwood in his normal good natured way takes no exception to any of the events and once again, as he is about to introduce \"Harvey,\" gets cut off, interrupted and ignored while Dr. Chumley pursues his patronizing commentary. Never one to interrupt, the pinnacle of politeness, Elwood lets him say whatever he is going to say and is finally given a pass to leave. Soon Veta's friends, including Judge Gaffney, and Myrtle Mae arrive. The mistake is uncovered, and the entire group goes into a panic trying to find Elwood. Veta and the Judge Gaffney promise to sue the sanitarium for wrongful incarceration and rough treatment. Distraught, Elwood drinks heavily and retires to his favorite watering hole, Charlie's. Dr. Chumley, himself, tracks Elwood down, but while he is doing this, everyone else is looking in other places. When it finally becomes apparent to everyone that the Doctor has been gone for over four hours and that Elwood is not back in custody, another major panic ensues and the group descends on Charlie's to see what has happened to Dr. Chumley.||||| Elwood, of course, is sitting alone, drinking, and maintains that the doctor left the bar with Harvey. They are convinced he is a madman and has done away with the doctor. However, in his easygoing and pleasant manner, Elwood sidetracks everyone with drinks and conversation and disarms them. Eventually the subject does turn back to the missing doctor, and the panic ensues again. The police are summoned, the heavy handed man in the white coat muscles Elwood back to the sanitarium, but not before becoming infatuated with Myrtle Mae and making advances toward her.||||| Although he is a big galoot, she's attracted to him. The entire entourage, of Veta, Myrtle Mae, Dr. Sanderson, Miss Kelly, Judge Gaffney, the guard and the police, arrive at the sanitarium in a police car and a taxi to discover the doctor is there. However, Dr. Chumley arrives back at the hospital with a look of admiration and fear. Dr. Chumley indeed did leave with Harvey, the Pooka, but he wisely does not say anything about it to anyone, dismisses them all and tells everyone that everything is under control. He tells Dr. Sanderson that he is a fine doctor and can have his job back, then disappears into his office. Sanderson then decides to administer a very powerful injection, called Formula 977, into Elwood that will make him cease with his delusions about the rabbit for once and for all.||||| Meanwhile the cab driver wants his money for the fare. No one seems to have any money so Veta says she'll pay. Digging everything out of her handbag, she discovers her money is gone. She assures the driver that if he waits until Elwood has his injection, she'll pay him handsomely when they are driven back home. The Cab driver however has dour insights into the effects of the injection about to be administered to Elwood. He says he's given many people a ride to the sanitarium for that injection and it changes them into crabby mean people; normal but irritable and unpleasant.||||| Elwood, the most disarming and engaging and mild mannered man in the universe, is on the verge of being turned permanently into a real nuisance, so Veta abruptly changes her mind and rushes in and prevents the injection. Dr. Chumley asks to see Elwood privately in his office where Elwood tells him tells the incredible story of how he came to meet Harvey, and explains the way in which people react when they meet them. Elwood also explains that Harvey has the power to stop time by saying:\n\n\"Did I tell you he could stop clocks? Well, you've heard the expression 'His face would stop a clock'? Well, Harvey can look at your clock and stop it. And you can go anywhere you like, with anyone you like, and stay as long as you like. And when you get back, not one minute will have ticked by. You see, science has overcome time and space. Well, Harvey has overcome not only time and space, but any objections.\"||||| By this point, Dr. Chumley is not only convinced of Harvey's existence, but has begun spending time with him on his own, and requests that Elwood allow Harvey to stay with him for a while and help him out by making his long-needed sabbatical a reality. Apparently this is one of the things Harvey can do if he is so inclined. Elwood asks Harvey if he will work with Chumley and tells Chumley that Harvey agrees. Dr. Sanderson pays for the cab and warms up to the nurse who has a crush on him. The entourage leaves, with the heavy-handed guard and Myrtle Mae making a date to see each other. As the sister digs in her pocketbook she discovers her money purse. She looks over her shoulder and says knowingly, \"Harvey,\" and shakes her head.||||| She knew Harvey existed, and was mischievous, and her only reason for wanting to have Elwood committed was that Elwood's insistence on introducing him to her guests was driving everyone away. As Elwood is leaving, Dr. Chumley asks Elwood for Harvey's help, and Elwood, being the obliging fellow he is, makes no objection. Dr. Chumley, arm in arm with an invisible companion, asks \"Have you ever been to Akron?\" In the final shot, after the gates to Chumley's Residence are closed, and Elwood is leaving, he stops, turns around and has a conversation with an invisible Harvey, who is already back from his trip to Akron (only a few minutes have gone by, but it was weeks due to Harvey the Pooka stopping time) and reaffirms their friendship. Harvey opens the security gate (showing only the control handles moving by themselves; Harvey is never seen on camera), and Elwood and his invisible companion saunter off towards the bus stop, following Veta and Myrtle Mae, towards the planned last stop of Charlie's Bar and another drink.","summary":"Mild-mannered Elwood P. Dowd leaves the house for the day with his invisible six-foot-three rabbit friend, Harvey, and is secretly watched by his sister, Veta Louise Simmons, and her daughter Myrtle Mae. As Veta is planning a party that day to launch Myrtle Mae into society, she is determined to keep her peculiar and chronically inebriated brother away from the house and, to that end, telephones her friend, Judge Omar Gaffney. Gaffney immediately dispatches an employee, who slips on a newly washed floor and is knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, Elwood arrives with Harvey at Charlie's, his favorite bar. Learning of Veta's party, Elwood returns home, and by genially introducing Harvey to the women attending the party, sends them all scurrying for the door. Myrtle Mae sees her hopes for a husband leaving with them, and in desperation, Veta decides to commit Elwood to a sanitarium. On hearing Veta's story, Miss Kelly, the nurse, assigns Elwood to a room, but when a confused and upset Veta then tries to explain Elwood's case to Dr. Lyman Sanderson, he commits her instead. Sanderson then scolds Kelly and sends her to apologize to Elwood, who unsuccessfully attempts to introduce Harvey to the preoccupied staff. As he is leaving the sanitarium, Elwood encounters Mrs. Chumley, the wife of the sanitarium head, and invites her to join him for a drink. When she declines, he asks her to send Harvey to the bar if she sees him inside and identifies his friend as a \"pooka.\" When Mrs. Chumley later reports this conversation to her husband, the doctors realize their mistake. Consulting her dictionary, Mrs. Chumley learns that a pooka is a fairy spirit that takes the form of a very large animal. In the meantime, an extremely upset Veta returns home. While she recovers upstairs, Marvin Wilson, the sanitarium attendant, comes looking for Elwood. Myrtle Mae is immediately attracted to him, and he returns her interest. Chumley then arrives and dispatches Wilson to the train station. Just as Veta announces that she is going to sue Chumley, Elwood phones from Charlie's looking for Harvey, and Chumley hurries to the bar. Back at the sanitarium, Wilson encounters the fired Sanderson, and when they realize that Chumley is overdue, Wilson, Sanderson and Kelly all hurry to Charlie's to look for him. There, Elwood explains that after a few drinks, Harvey and Chumley left for another bar. Wilson goes after him, leaving Kelly and Sanderson with Elwood. Elwood's gentle flirting with Kelly sparks Sanderson's interest in the nurse, who has long loved him. Elwood tells them he spends his days drinking with Harvey and talking to people in bars and relates the story of how he met Harvey. Wilson returns without Chumley but with the police, who convey Elwood to the sanitarium. Later, Chumley returns to the sanitarium and asks to speak privately with Elwood. After Chumley acknowledges Harvey's existence, he tells Elwood about Veta's plan to commit him. Soon afterward, Gaffney, Myrtle Mae and Veta arrive. Chumley rehires Sanderson, who then offers Elwood a serum that will make him shoulder his responsibilities and eliminate Harvey. Elwood declines, but when Veta explains how hard it has been to live with Harvey, he agrees to take the shot. While Elwood is in the examining room with Sanderson, Veta's taxi driver comes in to ask for his payment and describes the changes in people who have taken Sanderson's injection. At the thought that Elwood might stop enjoying life and become crabby, Veta stops Sanderson. Aware that Myrtle Mae is in love with Wilson, Elwood invites him to dinner. He then leaves with Harvey, but when Chumley begs him to leave Harvey behind, Elwood reluctantly agrees. Just as he passes the sanitarium gates, however, Harvey rejoins Elwood."}

Shortly, Del Boy enters, and he recognises the Australian man as being his old school friend and business partner, Jumbo Mills. Back in the 1960's, Del and Jumbo used to run a seafood stall outside the Nag's Head, until Jumbo emigrated to Australia in 1967, and now he is running a car business. Then, to prove if he's bald, Del yanks off Jumbo's wig when he's not looking. Rodney also enters, and Del introduces him and Albert to Jumbo. That evening, Del and Jumbo have a chat at the Nag's Head about how Del gave Jumbo his last PS200 when he went to Australia. Now, Jumbo wants to return the favour by asking Del to renew their partnership by running Jumbo's car business back in Australia. Del is reluctant at first, but agrees to the deal when Jumbo allows him to bring Rodney and Albert along.||||| Later, back at Nelson Mandela House, as Rodney and Albert are watching TV, Del returns and tells them that they're going to Australia. Rodney refuses to go, but changes his mind when Del shows him some photographs of Australia. They talk about how Jumbo will pay for their flight, and Rodney will be the head of a car-cleaning staff. Albert then speaks up and tells his nephews that he's not going with them to Australia, because Albert has had enough of travelling around the world with the Royal Navy, and just wants to settle down in Peckham during his retirement. Del and Rodney understand, and promise that they'll send money to Albert so he won't go poor. As Albert says thanks and goes off to bed, Rodney asks Del where they're going to live when they arrive in Australia, and Del says that Jumbo will allow them to live in his apartment for a while.||||| A few days later, Del gets a letter saying that he's been accepted for an immigration visa to Australia. Albert believes that nothing can go wrong. But Rodney walks into the lounge and tells his family that he's been refused an immigration visa because of his criminal conviction for smoking Cannabis at the art college in Basingstoke. As Albert heads off to the kitchen to keep out of the way, Del tells Rodney that he still wants to go to Australia and live out his dream of becoming a millionaire, even if it means ending their partnership. An irate Rodney complains to his older brother that he once had a golden opportunity to make money by becoming a window cleaner, but Del forced Rodney to give it up because of family ties.

With his mind made up, Del phones Jumbo to confirm what time he will be arriving. But instead, Del turns down Jumbo's offer, reluctantly admitting that he cannot leave his family behind. As Albert goes to bed, Rodney returns home to apologise to Del for the row they had earlier, and to tell his older brother that he needs to go to Australia. But Del tells Rodney that he's already turned down the offer. The Trotter brothers then talk about how Rodney was right when he told Del during their earlier argument, \"The real opportunity lies here.\" Britain is in a bad way, people want a good bargain, and they turn to men like the Trotters, who will be there, and that this time next year, they will be millionaires. The Trotter brothers make up, Rodney goes to bed happy, and Del secretly laments his lost opportunity for wealth by singing \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\"."}
{"id":"628a4ae15872456d93036fd08fb2e568","document":"Eren Jaeger stands momentarily speechless over the burned body of his childhood friend, Armin Arlelt . He realizes he should have known what would happen, but had no choice but to rely on him. Eren hears the weight of a Titan landing in the distance, and turns around in time to see the Cart Titan , carrying Zeke on its back. The Cart Titan gallops across the rooftops to reach Eren, who quickly moves to hold the unconscious Bertholdt Hoover hostage, placing his blade at the Warrior 's throat. As the Cart Titan stops, Eren gets a better look at Zeke and sees that he has marks around his face that shows he can turn into a Titan. He realizes that he is probably the Beast Titan . Zeke looks at Eren in shock and asks if he is Eren Jaeger. He says Eren looks nothing like his father and tells him that he knows what Eren is going through, as they are both victims of Grisha Jaeger. As Zeke tells Eren that he has been brainwashed by his father, Eren realizes that Zeke resembles Grisha.||||| However, Zeke looks up with consternation when he sees that Levi Ackermann has survived his battle with the remaining Titans and has climbed to the top of Wall Maria . Being in no shape to fight him again, Zeke calls their fight a draw and apologizes to the unconscious Bertholdt, saying that it is the end for him. The Cart Titan turns to leave and Zeke tells Eren that one day he will be coming back to rescue him. The Cart Titan gallops away with Zeke in tow.||||| Levi lands on the rooftop near Eren after using the last of his gas. He demands the rest of Eren's blades and gas so he can pursue Zeke. Eren begins to comply when he hears Armin gasp for breath. Elsewhere in Shiganshina District , Hange Zoe asks a conscious, but dismembered, Reiner Braun about a metal case that was in his chest pocket. He tells Hange that it is a letter written by Ymir , and that the Scouts need to deliver it to Christa . Hange agrees, but only after they inspect it. They would like to ask him more questions, but draws their blade, feeling that he is not inclined to talk. Reiner does not disagree.||||| However, when Hange begins to cut Reiner's throat, Jean Kirschtein asks them to wait, thinking they might be able to steal his power . Prior to beginning the operation, Erwin Smith had laid out guidelines for the use of the Scout Regiment 's one syringe of Titan injection , with the expectation that they could possibly take the Beast, Armored , or Colossal Titan 's powers. Not only could the Scouts gain valuable information regarding Titan powers, but they could also revive a single soldier on the brink of death. However, Hange does not feel that all the conditions have been met. Levi has the injection, but they do not know his status and they are uncertain they have the time to find out.||||| Even if Hange cuts off Reiner's head, they are not certain if that will actually kill him. Jean argues though, that this is not like Hange, and asks how they are supposed to beat the Titans if they back down because they lack the knowledge. Hange considers and asks Mikasa Ackermann to meet up with Eren and Armin to check out their situation, then to refill her gas and retrieve the injection from Levi. If she cannot, then she is to fire a signal flare as a signal to end Reiner. Mikasa agrees and flies off to find Levi.\n\nMikasa arrives to find Eren bent over Armin, desperately encouraging his friend to breathe. Eren hurriedly asks Levi for the syringe so they can have Armin eat Bertholdt. Levi, after a moment's hesitation, agrees and pulls out the case with the injection. Seeing this, Mikasa fires a signal flare as directed, but before Hange can kill Reiner, the Cart Titan gallops up behind them. Jean quickly fires his omni-directional mobility gear and pulls Hange out of the way before the Cart Titan can eat them.||||| Hange gets back up in time to see that the Cart Titan has picked up Reiner in its mouth, and it runs away with him and Zeke. Jean curses and blames himself for intervening when Hange was about to kill Reiner, but Hange reminds him that ultimately they made the call. Hange decides that they should regroup with the others. As Levi is about to hand Eren the Titan injection, Floch climbs up on the rooftop, carrying Erwin on his back. Erwin is severely wounded, but still alive, and Floch has been looking for Levi in hopes that the injection could save him. Seeing this, Levi takes back the injection and has Floch bring Erwin onto the roof. Levi inspects and confirms that Erwin is still breathing, then announces that Erwin will receive the injection. Eren is horrified, reminding Levi that he had already agreed to use it on Armin. Levi responds that he will revive the one who can save humanity. He hears a blade being drawn and turns to see that Mikasa has drawn her weapon, tears in her eyes.||||| On the Wall, Zeke surveys the wasteland of Shiganshina and notes that Reiner was incredibly lucky to have survived. Realizing what Eren and Mikasa intend, Levi asks them if they understand what they are doing. He reminds them that Erwin is their commander, and to stay out of his way. Eren grabs onto the serum in Levi's hand, and Levi orders him to keep his emotions in check. Eren then furiously asks why Levi did not use the serum on Armin right away. Levi admits that he was considering the possibility of Erwin still being alive, and now that Erwin is here, he will receive the injection. Eren tightens his grip on the Titan injection, and Levi, losing his patience, strikes Eren with his fist, knocking out several of his teeth and sending him flying. Outraged, Mikasa lunges at Levi and puts her blade to his throat. She realizes that Levi has been weakened from his previous battles, and she is certain that she can take the injection from him by force.||||| Both Levi and Floch appeal to her sense of reason and the need to save Erwin so they can use his talents to save humanity. Though Eren is barely able to speak, he counters that it would be no different if they lose Armin. Armin discovered Annie Leonhart 's identity as the Female Titan , he was the one who came up with the plan to save Trost and thought of moving soldiers at night, and it was thanks to Armin that they found Reiner and defeated Bertholdt. Eren believes that Armin will be the one who will save humanity, not Erwin or even Eren himself.||||| Mikasa renews her efforts to take the injection from Levi, but Floch stands up to her, saying that she is not the only one who has had it rough. Floch lets her know that all of the Scouts that were on the other side of the Wall are dead, killed by the Beast Titan's barrage. Erwin came up with a plan to fight back against the Beast Titan, and Floch's comrades were all slaughtered just as planned. When Floch found Erwin, he thought about killing him, but decided that would have been too easy. He wants Erwin to endure more of this hell, but then he looked to his left and saw Levi killing the Titans, and is reminded of the Titan injection. It takes a devil to fight the Titans, and Floch believes he was spared from dying so that he could bring Erwin back.||||| Floch tries to take the injection and Mikasa moves to intercept him, but Hange grabs her first and manages to pull her away before she can strike him. The rest of the squad has arrived now, and is able to see the choice that must be made. Levi gets up and opens the injection case, preparing to inject Erwin. Mikasa screams and Hange reminds her of how much they need Erwin and that they know what it is like to lose people.||||| Hange is only here now because Moblit Berner had died pushing them into a well to escape the Colossal Titan's transformation blast. Though there are countless people Hange wants to bring back, there comes a time to say farewell, and they have no choice but to keep moving forward. Hearing this, Mikasa finally relents and Levi prepares the injection. However, Eren weakly pulls at Levi's leg and asks him if he knows about the sea. Despite Floch's intervention, Eren tells Levi about Armin's dream to look at the sea, and admits that, though he was only ever driven by hatred of the Titans, Armin is not like him, and has dreams of his own. Levi glances at Armin's body and then gives the order for everyone to clear out so he can have Erwin eat Bertholdt. The group relocates, with Floch taking Eren away so he cannot intervene, and Levi is left alone.||||| Levi drags Bertholdt into position as he thinks about Erwin and Armin's respective dreams. He takes Erwin's arm and prepares to give him the injection when Erwin suddenly lifts it out of his grip and raises his hand, apparently believing himself to be back in his father's classroom. Delirious, Erwin asks his father how they can know for sure that there are no more humans outside the Walls. Levi regards him with surprise and remembers how he asked Erwin to give up on his dream, and how his uncle Kenny Ackermann had spoken about how people could only keep going if they were drunk on something. Remembering Erwin's gratitude to him, Levi makes his choice. Bertholdt wakes up in time to see a small blond Titan looming over him.||||| He begins to struggle and notices his former friends watching from several rooftops away. Bertholdt panics and cries out for help, but to no avail. As he screams for Annie and Reiner, Armin's Titan closes its jaws on his head and devours him. Floch asks Levi why he changed his mind as Levi and Hange sit beside Erwin's body. Levi explains that Erwin only became a devil because that was what was needed of him. He had been set free, but they were about to drag him back for more, and Levi decided it was time to let him rest. Levi apologizes to Erwin that he was not able to kill the Beast Titan like he promised, so he will have to wait. Hange inspects Erwin and lets Levi know that he has passed away. Behind them, the blond Titan collapses to the ground. Eren, Mikasa and the other 104th cadets surround it as Armin Arlelt emerges from the Titan, unharmed and healed.","summary":"Eren finds himself alone with Armin's burnt body and the unconscious Bertholdt. His reverie is interrupted by the Cart Titan carrying the blond man, who asserts that Eren was lied to by his father. The blond man departs when Levi arrives, still in pursuit, promising to return and save Eren. Elsewhere, after Reiner hands her a letter from Ymir, Hange was about to kill him before convinced by Jean to have Mikasa fetch the Titan serum from Levi so they can transfer the Armored Titan power to one of their own. But as the Cart Titan rescues Reiner, Mikasa learns from Eren that Armin is still alive as Levi prepares to inject him with the serum. But Floch Forster, the only surviving recruit from the suicide charge, arrives with the mortally wounded Erwin. This causes Levi to consider Erwin instead, causing Eren and Mikasa to openly defy that decision with the latter attacking Levi until being restrained by Hange. Once everyone calms down, Levi orders everyone to leave and prepares to inject Erwin. But Erwin withdraws his arm in delirium, causing Levi to recall his conversation with Erwin before the suicide charge and ultimately chooses to let the commander rest in peace and give the serum to Armin instead. As Erwin succumbs, Armin becomes a mindless Titan and eats Bertholdt. Levi and Hange mourn the deceased Erwin while the rest of the squad share an emotional moment as Armin emerges healed from his Titan form."}

Shaq has to make a free throw with a huge rock in order to get the saw down to cut off their legs (spoofing Shaq's famous difficulties at the free-throw line). Shaq and Dr. Phil have only two minutes to free themselves of their leg braces before dying from the room's airborne nerve gas. Finally, Shaq makes the basket and lowers the saws down. Dr. Phil ends up sawing off the wrong foot, thereby remaining chained and the two are presumed to be dead. Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen), spoofing Bill Pullman's character from The Grudge, wakes up.||||| There are three girls (from The Girls Next Door on E!) in his bed who later have a pillow fight. He tries to kill himself by taking too many sleeping pills but the pills turn out to be Viagra, resulting in him tumbling over a balustrade, landing on his erect penis, and dying. Cindy Campbell goes to get a new job (parodying Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in The Grudge). She's been asked to be a caretaker for the creepy \"Grudge House.\" She receives a tour inside, Cindy expects nothing and she gets a 'feeling of evil' as the guide tries to hide the overflowing hair on the ceiling, in drawers and baskets and on his head; and The Grudge Boy in the bathtub by pushing him down with a plunger, and then walks out naked and Cindy smiles and says \"I'll take it\".||||| Meanwhile, Cindy's neighbour Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko), spoofing Tom Cruise's character in War of the Worlds, gets fired from his job as a crane operator at the docks. At a bar afterwards he runs into Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) where it is revealed, in a parody of Brokeback Mountain, that the two have started a homosexual relationship. Tom gets home, where his ex-wife (Molly Shannon) has just arrived with his children, Robbie and Rachel, who both resent him. Cindy's job is to look after the incapacitated Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman), however she is incompetent at it, to the point of accidentally sponge bathing Mrs. Norris with her own urine. Throughout the night Cindy notices strange events going on in the house, culminating in her finding a ghostly boy in the attic.||||| The next morning she confides in Tom about the events of the previous night, which leads to a conversation about their past relationships.||||| Cindy has a flashback to her first marriage, showing a big African-American man cussing her out, and then another to her second marriage, to the death of her husband George (Simon Rex) where, in a parody of Million Dollar Baby, George trips and breaks his neck (as do numerous members of the audience) during a boxing match between Cindy and Tiffany Stone, a female version of Mike Tyson also showing a pile of bitten-off ears. As they share a kiss, the sky suddenly goes stormy and everything electrical stops working (In the real movie cars stopped working, but in this movie cars, bicycles, skateboards and a man runs out of a toilet, trousers down and holding a newspaper (\"My bowels have stopped moving!\"). Tom goes to investigate, and discovers the world has come under attack by gigantic triPods (giant iPods) that play 80s music... and then switches to the \"Destroy Humanity\" playlist, transforming the iPods into actual Tripods, which vaporize the humans they zap (it was also showed three people which seemed to be rappers, get vaporized and dropping a huge pile of bling-blings).||||| Cindy runs back into her house and finds the ghost boy again. They began talking in \"Japanese\" (actually Japanese brand names and \"buzz words\" such as Sony, Mitsubishi, and Fujitsu), in what may be a parody of the scene between Beatrix Kiddo and Pai Mei in Kill Bill in which Pai Mei says \"Your Japanese is lousy. It dishonors my ears.\", which the ghost boy says to Cindy. She is told by the ghost boy that she can find the answer to the alien attack when she finds his father. He gives her directions to his location but Cindy couldn't read them so they transformed into a Yahoo map so that Cindy could read it. Tom splits up with Cindy and flees with his kids. Cindy runs into Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), who apparently faked her death in Scary Movie 3, and together they manage to find the last working car and follow the directions of the ghost boy.||||| The scene then changes to the President of the United States being informed that aliens are attacking. President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen) is sitting in Edna R. Penhall Elementary School, listening to a book being read (something about a duck); when his aide Jamison (Alonzo Bodden) comes, he sits motionless, wanting to hear the rest of the story. This mirrors George W. Bush's being read a children's story for seven minutes, after being told about the September 11 attacks.||||| At an emergency session of the UN, and a round of horribly inappropriate jokes, President Harris reveals a weapon made to combat the aliens. Scientists have taken the lasers used by the TriPods, which kill the people but leave their clothes behind, and modified it to do the opposite to the aliens. The members of the UN get an unexpected, and quite unwelcome, demonstration when President Harris accidentally hits the switch and is soon standing in front of all the delegates, completely unaware that he is totally naked. Its not long before the entire UN is stark naked. Baxter's aide Harper (Bryan Callen) tells Baxter that he's naked too where Baxter thinks that he was wearing a wrinkly leather coat. Harper escorts the President out of the UN.||||| Cindy and Brenda come across a village that is a hundred years behind modern times. After unsuccessfully trying to steal clothes off some villagers, they take some from a laundry basket and attempt to fit in. Unfortunately, they are captured and are taken into a court to decide their fate. Henry Hale (Bill Pullman), the head of the village, rules that Cindy and Brenda may stay in the village, but they may never leave. Tom and his children run into a battle between the Army and triPods.||||| Robbie decides to join the fight, excited by the graphic violence. While Tom tries to dissuade him, Michael Jackson (who has gathered a bunch of children) tries to persuade Rachel to come with him, but Tom manages to stop her in time. Unfortunately, Robbie gets away. Jackson is zapped by the triPod's heat ray; the first blast causes him to revert to his Bad appearance, the second into his Thriller appearance, and the third reveals his true form - a balding middle-aged black man - before a fourth blast destroys him totally, leaving only his nose. Tom and his daughter flee into house protected by Oliver (Michael Madsen), parodying Tim Robbins' character from War of the Worlds, who is telling them that they should make their own tripods (\"Ours will have FOUR legs\").||||| That night, the village is attacked by Those We Don't Speak Of, however it is discovered that they are simply villagers in costumes. Next door, Henry is stabbed by the mentally challenged Ezekiel (Chris Elliott). Henry reveals to Cindy and Brenda that he is the father of the ghost boy, who was killed at Cindy's boxing match because everyone snapped their necks and Don King crushed him. He tells Cindy that only she has the power to defeat the triPods. At that point, Cindy and Brenda get captured by a triPod, as do Tom and Rachel. The characters wake up in the bathroom from Saw. Cindy and Brenda are wearing the \"Venus Fly Trap\" from Saw II and Tom is wearing a device that would shoot a large dildo into his anus.||||| Jigsaw appears on a monitor on the wall, and tells them they have 60 seconds to get the Venus Fly Traps off before they close. Eventually, Cindy figures out (after much prompting) that she has to get the key from behind her eye, which she does with ease, because the key was behind a glass eye she got due to a \"bad bar fight in '96\".||||| Cindy frees them from their traps, and Tom's kids come down from the ceiling, about to be sliced into bits unless he holds onto a rope which happens to be between an iron maiden. He grabs onto the rope which leaves him open to another torture device called the Nut Cracker, which gives him various punishments such as kicking his crotch, and giving him a purple nurple and a wet willy. Moments before their deaths, Cindy finds photos in the toilet of Jigsaw, a woman, and the ghost boy, and realizes that Jigsaw was the ghost boy's real father, and the entire invasion was revenge for his son's death. He then says \"Anyone can hold a grudge, but it takes real courage to forgive,\" and it is at this time that Jigsaw comes into the spotlight. He then tells them that the invasion is over and allows them to leave.||||| He apologizes for the invasion and killing millions of people, and then Brenda (who went through a rotating wall into the control room earlier) and Jigsaw's brother, Zoltar, emerge from the other room, where they have just had sex. Jigsaw asks Zoltar if he caught anything, Zoltar replies that Brenda (untruthfully) told him she was a virgin and Jigsaw finishes by saying \"We are so fucked.\"||||| Nine months later, Brenda gives birth to a baby that looks just like Jigsaw and Zoltar. After that, James Earl Jones gets hit by a bus (which may be referring to what happened to Terry in Final Destination) while delivering Morgan Freeman's closing lines from War of the Worlds. A five minute epilogue spoofs the Tom Cruise couch incident by showing an Oprah Winfrey Show episode with Tom Ryan jumping on a couch with Oprah (played by Debra Wilson). Tom runs around the studio, does backflips (performed by David Leighton), swings across the studio, and chews/rips apart one of the couch cushions. Cindy Campbell walks in and gets thrown by Tom off the stage. Tom then breaks Oprah's hands and wrists, smashes a chair over her head, runs towards the camera lens, and the screen goes black.","summary":"Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a bathroom.

Despite Jerry's complaint of fever, James whisks him by helicopter to a remote giant sinkhole, where Jerry helps James and his assistants set up cones to catch falling butterflies as James pumps smoke into the trees. Several huge spiders also fall, and James captures two in jars, but a third spider slips into Jerry Manley's backpack. Back in camp, as James studies the spiders, he notes that, like solider ants, they have no reproductive organs. While Jerry rests in his tent, the third spider crawls from his backpack and delivers a fatal bite to his stomach. Thinking Jerry died of fever, James packs his body into a box to be shipped home, but the spider slips inside. When the body arrives in Canaima, California, mortician Irv Kendall is shocked at its desiccated condition, as if something sucked it dry. The spider sneaks out of the box and escapes through a cat door.||||| A crow swoops down and picks it up, but soon plummets lifelessly into the yard of a house where Dr. Ross Jennings, his wife Molly, and children Tommy and Shelley have just arrived from San Francisco, California. Dr. Jennings has chosen to take over as town physician when Dr. Samuel \"Sam\" Metcalf retires the following week. Tommy Jennings sees the large spider and reports it to his mother, who finds a smaller, harmless spider instead and releases it in the barn out back. The foreign spider joins the domestic spider, and the two mate. When Dr. Jennings visits Sam to discuss taking over his practice, the old physician has second thoughts about retiring. Jennings panics, because he has bought a house and rented an office in Canaima. Retired schoolteacher Margaret Hollins volunteers to be his first patient, and when he gives her a check-up, he discovers that Sam unnecessarily put Margaret on high blood pressure medication.||||| Meanwhile, Molly, an amateur photographer, takes pictures of a large web in the barn. Hoping to cure her husband of his fear of spiders, she takes him to see it, but Ross is terrified by his earliest childhood memory of a spider crawling on him. Just out of sight in the loft, an egg sac pulsates. Later, Margaret throws a lawn party to introduce Dr. Jennings to the townspeople, and Tommy and Shelley make friends with neighbor Bunny Beechwood, whose father, Henry Beechwood, is the high school coach. Other guests include Jerry Manley's parents, grieving over their son's death and angry they could not view his body before burial. That evening, a spider gets into Margaret's house and fatally bites her hand. The next day, Dr. Jennings attempts to convert his basement into a wine cellar, but the wood is rotten. When he fires a nail gun into the ceiling, the nails shoot through the floor boards above.||||| He goes to Margaret's to thank her for the party, and sees her body through a window. Sam Metcalf declares she had a heart attack and blames Ross for taking her off blood pressure pills. Recognizing signs of convulsion, Ross suggests an autopsy, but Sam refuses, because locals object to having their bodies desecrated. Margaret is buried without being examined. Meanwhile, Molly Jennings hires local exterminator Delbert McClintock to check the house for termites, but he finds only \"bad wood.\" Henry Beechwood asks Dr. Jennings to give his football players physical examinations. Later, during practice, a spider crawls into a football helmet. After player Todd Miller puts it on, he is bitten while being tackled and dies. His teammates surround him, take off the helmet, and lay it aside. Nobody sees the spider crawling out, but a player steps on it and kills the arachnid without noticing.||||| Though Todd's death is blamed on the tackle, some wonder if Dr. Jennings is to blame and call him \"Dr. Death.\" That night, Dr. Sam Metcalf steps off his treadmill before bed, puts his foot into a slipper, and is bitten. His wife, Evelyn, calls Dr. Jennings, but the old doctor is dead by the time he arrives. When County Medical Examiner Milton \"Milt\" Briggs arrives, Dr. Jennings tells him that Metcalf's wife saw a spider, then shows him a bite on the old doctor's toe. Milt argues, however, that spider bites are rarely fatal. He blames the elderly doctor's death on overexertion on the treadmill. Dr. Jennings demands an autopsy, and the next day, Briggs telephones to say Dr. Metcalf died from a tiny amount of unknown toxin. Over the objection of Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, Dr. Jennings asks Milt to exhume Todd Miller and Margaret Hollins.||||| Dr. Jennings warns his children to watch out for spiders. While playing with Bunny at the Beechwood house, Shelley Jennings is almost bitten by a spider, but Bunny innocently drops a large book on it. Meanwhile, Ross finds a cricket in the house and realizes he has not heard them lately, even though crickets chirping on quiet evenings was one of Canaima's selling points. Seeing that Dr. James Atherton, one of America's foremost entomologists, is studying spiders at a California university, he telephones him. Atherton tells him that people frequently report false outbreaks of spider deaths. However, after he hangs up, Dr. Atherton vaguely recalls the name Canaima. Studying his new species of Venezuelan spiders, he asks his assistant, Chris Collins, to investigate. Chris arrives in Canaima just as Dr. Jennings and Milt find spider bites on the exhumed bodies of Todd Miller and Margaret Hollis. The young assistant telephones Dr. Atherton and asks him to come.||||| The next day, as Dr. Jennings, Milt, Sheriff Parsons, and Chris search Margaret's property, they find a large web filled with fragments of crickets, along with a dead spider. Chris Collins observes that another spider drained it, because spiders are like vampires. Suddenly, a spider menaces them. Dr. Jennings freezes with fear, but makes enough movement to distract the spider, allowing Chris to drop a glass over it. Nearby, as Bunny's older sister, Becky Beechwood, takes a shower, a spider drops on her from the shower rod, but the rushing water sends it skittering down into the drain. Henry Beechwood telephones Delbert McClintock, who arrives and finds a spider on the front walk. The exterminator's insecticide has no effect, however, so he squashes the spider with his boot. When Dr. James Atherton arrives in town, Dr. Jennings claims that he and Irv Kendall have already figured out that a spider escaped from his Venezuelan camp in Jerry Manley's casket.||||| Studying the captured spider, Atherton notes the huge fangs and the lack of sex organs, which is uncharacteristic of spiders, except for the Venezuelan species. He explains that this type of spider has been trapped for millennia in a deep gorge, but now one of them has mated with a local species, and their offspring will spread out. Though these sexless spiders will soon die, a new queen has probably been born, and her offspring will be unstoppable. Her nest must be destroyed. That night, at Irv Kendall's house, a spider gets into a bowl of popcorn and kills him and his wife. The next day, when Atherton goes to Dr. Jennings' office with Sheriff Parsons, he sees Molly's photographs of the huge barn web and demands to go there. Elsewhere, Chris Collins tells Dr. Jennings the queen will be hiding in a dark, musty place, and no other spiders will be around because the queen protects her babies.||||| Plotting a map of where spiders were seen or people were bitten, Chris draws a circle around the Jennings house. Meanwhile, as Atherton investigates the web in the barn, the original Venezuelan spider fatally bites him. Dr. Jennings arrives to evacuate his family, but they are surrounded by hundreds of spiders and must escape through an upstairs window. However, Jennings again freezes at the top of the stairs and tumbles over the railing. He crashes through the rotted ground floor and lands in the cellar. Seeing no spiders, he knows from what Chris Collins said that this must be where the queen is hiding.||||| When it attacks him, he shovels the spider toward a broken fuse box and electrocutes her. Finding a giant egg sac, he douses it with wine. As the original Venezuelan spider drops down on him, he knocks it away, chases it with flames, and sets part of the basement on fire. He momentarily freezes as the spider crawls up his leg, then knocks it away into the fire. As the flaming creature leaps at him again, Ross fires his nail gun and sends the burning spider into the egg sac, setting it afire. Delbert McClintock pulls him to safety. Later, Dr. Jennings and his wife, having returned to San Francisco, drink wine, happy to be home. After their ordeal, they are only mildly disturbed when an earthquake hits.","summary":"In a Venezuelan tepui, entomologist James Atherton captures two members of an aggressive new species of spider of prehistoric origin. The spiders lack sex organs, indicating that they are laborers or soldiers, thereby existing as a hive (atypical of spiders). A fertile male of the same species bites bedridden American nature photographer Jerry Manley, who has a severe seizure from the venom and dies. The scientist sends Manley's body back to his hometown of Canaima, California, unaware that the spider has crawled into the coffin.\n\nManley's desiccated body arrives at the mortuary of mortician Irv Kendall. The spider escapes from the coffin, is picked up by a crow and bites the bird. The crow falls dead outside the barn of Ross Jennings, a family physician who has moved from San Francisco to take over the practice of the retiring town doctor. Like his son, Ross has arachnophobia.\n\nHe is short of patients after Sam Metcalf, the elderly town doctor, hesitates about retiring. The Venezuelan spider mates with a house spider in the Jennings's barn. The domestic spider produces hundreds of infertile, drone offspring with their father's lethal bite, and they leave the nest after consuming her.\n\nRoss's first patient, Margaret Hollins, dies after being bitten by one of the new spiders, and he doubts Metcalf's diagnosis of a heart attack. Another spider kills high school football player Todd Miller just after Ross conducted a routine team checkup, earning him the nickname of \"Dr. Death\". The next victim is Metcalf, who is bitten and dies in front of his wife.\n\nWith Metcalf dead, Ross becomes Canaima's town doctor. Knowing that Metcalf was bitten by a spider and a minute amount of an unknown toxin was detected in his body, he suspects that the town may be infested by deadly arachnids.\n\nRoss calls Atherton and asks him to help his investigation. The skeptical Atherton sends Chris Collins, his assistant. Ross and county coroner Milt Briggs order that Hollins and Miller be exhumed. They perform autopsies, and Chris confirms Ross's suspicion after he identifies bite marks. Ross and Chris catch one of the spiders in Metcalf's house the following day. When Chris mentions the new species discovered by Atherton, Ross realizes that the town's killer spiders and Atherton's discovery are related.\n\nAtherton joins Ross, Chris, Milt, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons, and exterminator Delbert McClintock in Canaima, and they discover the spiders have a short lifespan due to their crossbreeding. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers sent to eliminate potential threats for the head male spider which he calls \"the general\". He learns that the general produced a queen and inbred with her to produce a second nest (guarded by the queen) which could produce fertile offspring, culminating in worldwide dispersal.\n\nRoss, Chris, and Delbert discover that one nest is in Ross's barn. When he destroys the nest, Delbert finds Atherton dead - bitten by the general before it escaped. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar: the spiders' second nest, guarded by the queen and the general.\n\nAfter he electrocutes the queen, Ross battles the general while he tries to burn the second egg sac (overcoming his fear of spiders by focusing on his need to stop them). Trapped by fallen debris as the general prepares to bite him, Ross stays perfectly still until the general is in position, then flings the spider into the fire; as the egg sac hatches, the general jumps out of the fire. Ross shoots it with a nail gun, sending the flaming spider into the egg sac and destroying the nest. Delbert rescues Ross: with the general, the queen and the nests destroyed and the soldiers dying, the spiders' threat is over. Deciding that they missed their old life, the Jennings family returns to San Francisco."}

Vincent have to keep their marriage a secret when investigator, Daniel Breeden, uncovers evidence that may show that the governor took a bribe from John F. Holdstock, an embezzling financier he pardoned. John's private secretary, Willis Martin, who deposited the bribe money in the governor's private bank account, tells Robert and Daniel that he knows of no business between John and the governor that would explain the money. Sheldon goes to the Governor's Residence to tell Ruth about the situation, and that he is obligated to present the evidence to a legislative investigation committee. Ruth is certain that her father did not take a bribe, and that John can explain everything, but they learn by phone from Daniel that John has committed suicide. The Governor is concerned about the allegations, but his financial backer, Jim Lansdale, calms him down, and takes him to lunch. Before he does he makes a phone call in which he learns that Sheldon is at the Governor's residence, but he does not tell the Governor this.||||| In John's papers, Robert finds a typed note which apparently provides a motive for the bribe: \"My dear friend John ... the expense of maintaining my sockfarm has exceeded the income during the year ... the time for the matter we discussed has come. W.H.V.\" Robert rushes to show it to Ruth, and they decide to take it to police headquarters to be compared with a sample from the governor's personal typewriter. Lt. Tom Nigard shows them the comparison: both samples are definitely from the same machine. Ruth returns home to tell her father about the evidence, and he adamantly denies that he wrote the note, giving her his word of honor. That night, Daniel goes to John's office, where a very spooked Willis is still working. Daniel tries to calm him down, telling him \"You have nothing to worry about, it's almost over. I've seen you through today as I promised, haven't I? ... You were splendid today in Robert's office. You just stick to your story and remember that I'm taking care of you.\"||||| Ruth goes to Robert's apartment to tell him that she's absolutely certain her father is innocent. While she is there, Sheldon's secretary, Hazel Normandie leaves for the day, planning to meet Daniel, her boyfriend, outside the building. As he walks up to her, Daniel is shot dead. Ruth has seen everything from the window, and knows that Hazel didn't fire the shot, but cannot tell the police because of her secret marriage to Robert: if it was learned that she was in his apartment at night, she fears that their marriage will be discovered. The police investigation of Daniel's murder determines that the gun used to kill him belonged to Hazel, the same gun that Daniel took from her earlier in the day, saying that he was all the protection she needed. At a raucous session of the legislature, Representative McPherson, from the party opposing the Governor, accuses both the governor and Attorney General Sheldon of withholding evidence from the investigative committee. They are staunchly defended by Representative Grosvenor, but McPherson demands articles of impeachment against the governor and intensive investigation of Robert. Ruth observes it all from the gallery.||||| Hazel is standing trial for the murder of Daniel, with the case about to go to the jury, but Ruth still refuses to testify, knowing that the revelation of her secret marriage with Robert would end his career. With little time to waste, Ruth goes to the apartment of Willis, who appears to be cracking up. Willis admits to her that John didn't commit suicide, he was murdered, and says that he is willing to tell Robert so, but once at Robert's office he runs away; Sheldon puts out an alert for the police to pick him up. Now, with no other choice, he and Ruth head to the courthouse, where the jury is voting, and find Hazel's attorney. The judge reopens the case to allow Ruth to testify, and Hazel is acquitted. The next morning, Governor Vincent is annoyed that Ruth didn't tell him about the marriage, but understands that the circumstances necessitated it. With the governor's impeachment trial due to start soon, Jim Lansdale counsels the governor to resign, but he refuses. Meanwhile, the legislature demands that Attorney General Sheldon resign, but he, too, refuses.||||| The police find Willis and bring him to Robert. Representative McPherson issues subpoenas for Willis and Robert to testify before the committee, where the existence of the typed letter apparently from the governor to John comes out. Willis admits that Daniel made him put the letter into John's files, and then sent him to John to demand the money he lost in John's crash. When John denied he had any money, Willis shot and killed him, and Daniel fixed it to look like suicide. The whole frame-up, according to Willia, is the work of Jim Lansdale, supposedly the governor's friend and financial backer: ever since the governor vetoed a highway bill that would have made him millions, Lansdale had been working to bring down his old friend. It was Lansdale who typed the letter on the typewriter in the governor's study. As the committee votes to drop the charges against the governor, Lansdale slowly leaves the room and kills himself. Afterwards, the governor gives his blessing to the marriage of his daughter and Robert, and they kiss. == Cast ==","summary":"District Attorney Robert Sheldon is secretly married to Governor Vincent's daughter Ruth. When Dave Bredeen, Sheldon's assistant, informs him that the governor has been accused of taking a bribe and Sheldon is put in charge of the investigation, Ruth feels they should keep their marriage a secret, so that no one will think he is a prejudiced investigator. The charges against Vincent stem from money that John Holdstock's secretary, Willis Martin, deposited in Vincent's personal bank account. Everyone believes that the money was a reward for Vincent's pardon of Holdstock, and Holdstock commits suicide before he can confirm or deny this. Every piece of evidence that Sherman uncovers seems to point to Vincent's guilt, but Ruth continues to believe in her father's innocence. As Ruth waits for Sherman late one night in his apartment, she witnesses Bredeen's murder. From her vantage point, she can see that Hazel Normandie, Sherman's secretary, definitely did not do the shooting, but she refuses to testify because she would have to reveal her marriage in order to explain her presence in Sherman's apartment.

Before the race begins, Sally learns Jack's real identity, and even though the horse wins, she and Peter have Jack paid off. At a dance before the derby, Jack explains to Sally that he didn't think she would allow him to train her horse if she knew he was a Dillon, and she accuses him of trying to insure Postman's victory.||||| Before he leaves her, he warns that Blue Grass's jockey should not use a whip, because the horse sulks when he is whipped.

As we open Nathan knocks on the door is greeted by Billie Green, doll collector. She takes him into the dining room where her black doll collection is displayed. Billie Green is watching closely as he carefully is examining the dolls. Nathan asks he was seeing. Billie reaches for one specific doll, \"Baby Nancy\" and says that this is the doll that changed the toy industry. Nathan looks at Billie in wonderment with one question, how? Green explains that before this doll other black doll representations were either negative stereotypes such as a Mamie or Uncle Tom, or the mold used was a white doll with brown paint. But this doll, Baby Nancy, she was specifically designed to have black features, natural hair and was modeled after a young black girl in the community of South LA.||||| Green turns the doll over to show the back of the neck, and shows Nathan that it is inscribed with \"Shindana Toys\" and underneath \"Division of Operation Bootstrap\". Green gives the history of Operation Bootstrap and that this organization grew from the Watts uprising by two men in particular, Lou Smith and Robert Hall, bringing training and education to the neighborhood as well as partnering with local organizations and businesses to enhance the neighborhood. Green explains that there was a shift in the community to self-identify and one of the most successful initiatives of Operation Bootstrap, Shindana Toy Company, was pivotal to this for young kids both black and white. Hester explains how the psyche behind Shindana was to give black children a doll that they could identify with as well as to teach children tolerance. The company even marketed the doll to both black and white children to teach them how to relate at a young age.||||| She goes on to explain that the success transformed the doll industry and grew so large that it opened up distribution centers in New York, Chicago, and Houston. Green points out her specific dolls and explains that they reached to celebrities like Flip Wilson and Dr. J. And they even created a \"lil cousins\" brand that which featured multicultural dolls, expanding their brand. Green shares the stories behind her dolls and personal connection behind collecting them. Nathan thanks Billie for her time and heads out. Nathan a bit blown away by all the information Green and Hester just told him, that a doll changed the toy industry and Operation Bootstrap changed a community, heeds Yolanda's suggestion and heads to a small library in the heart of South LA, Southern California Library\n\nNathan walks into the library and to the main desk asking for any materials they may have on Operation Bootstrap||||| The owner mentions that they are upstairs and to follow her\n\nNathan and the owner head upstairs and she goes down the long shelves to pull out a folder and motions to the table. Nathan sits down at the table researching the folder and seeing what he can find. Nathan is greeted by the owner and librarian at the Library and he explains that he is looking for information on Shindana and Bootstrap. She takes him up to a small research table upstairs surrounded by periodicals and brings out a small file, that reads \"20th Century Organizational Files.\" The librarian explains that there is not much left on it, and most of the stories live with the people that were involved in it. He flips to an article from Business Weekly, 1967. He reads:\n\n\"Operation Bootstrap, an ambitious self-help program in LA, is aiding hundreds of Negroes - once considered all but unemployable - to find jobs. Its program includes vocational training that makes use of $100,000 worth of equipment loaned by such firms as IBM, Singer, Litton Industries, and Scientific Data Systems.\"||||| Most narratives of the aftermath of the Watts Uprising focus on how businesses left the community...but these documents suggest that that's not the whole story, not even close. This is a story about resilience, community strength and economic revival...and outside of the black community in South LA, this story is barely known. Besides coming out of the Watts uprising, how did Operation Bootstrap start? And was a Toy Factory at the heart of it? Nathan takes a few pictures of the Operation Bootstrap documents he made and places his iPad he was taking notes on in his satchel. He puts on his hat and out the door he goes. Nathan then heads to the Dunbar Hotel to meet with Marva Smith and David Crittendon. The wife of the late Lou Smith, who was the co-founder of Operation Bootstrap, and close friend of family and Operation Bootstrap. The location of the organization is less than 300 ft from where Nathan and Marva are sitting now.||||| Smith, Crittendon and Nathan sit drinking coffee and chatting about why Lou started Operation Bootstrap, the black community in Los Angeles reacted to the existential and economic devastation of the 1965 Watts riots. Lou Smith and Robert Hall wanted to give South LA education in vocational jobs as well as remedial studies like English and math. As the conversation continues, Nathan continues to ask questions. His understanding of South Los Angeles after the riots is that businesses fled and the community was left in socioeconomic distress, but he hasn't heard this more positive narrative of self-help organizations like Operation Bootstrap let alone this toy factory! Smith goes on to say that Operation Bootstrap, however, did not just have impact on those within the community. The organization also provided an opportunity for those outside the neighborhood to have open dialogues around race and racism in 1960s Los Angeles. A clip plays from the UCLA documentary \"Sensitivity Sessions.\"||||| Smith tells him that Operation Bootstrap was extremely successful, they trained many individuals throughout the community and opened multiple businesses, and the story of one individual they saw transform before their eyes, Lewis Kiwasi. He was known as the kid in the neighborhood that did not try and did his same thing every day, but really took what Operation Bootstrap did and found a place for his potential and thrived, even to succeed Lou Smith after his passing. She suggests that Nathan sees the Conner Family, three women that thrived from Operation bootstrap, Doris Conner, was the dress designer and maker for Shindana Dolls. Nathan Masters drives up and parks out front of Irie Vibes Art Space. As Nathan arrives, the Conners have tables set up in the same way they would for their weekly sewing classes. Nathan walks into Irie Vibes and is greeted by Doris, Tuesday and Lynne.||||| Nathan meets the Conner Family: Doris Conner and her daughters Tuesday and Lynne, who all worked at the Shindana factory at its height. As Tuesday is teaching Nathan the process of pattern, pinning and sewing, he acknowledges that with the size of the company, their job must have been no small task. He asks about the impact that working for Shindana had for them. They explain that they owe their success as business owners to Shindana and Operation Bootstrap. They pull a doll out and mention, \"just like how this doll transformed the doll industry, it also transformed our lives.\" For the Conner's, and for many children in South LA and beyond, It was about seeing themselves represented in the world. But they make the point that Shindana wasn't just about making black dolls, we made Latino dolls, Asian dolls, etc. It was about equity in representation...and you'd be surprised just how much that can matter in child's life.||||| The Conner's talk about what they do today, design, act, provide a space for the community to come and have a jam session or learn a vocational job, like sewing. Lynne reflects that their mom always taught them that if you could do something with your hands you would never go hungry, From their roots they learned to be part of the community and to give back and that is exactly what they continue to do today at their own shop. The Conner's tell Nathan that Mattel funded and helped get Operation Bootstrap off the ground.||||| Nathan ends his journey at Leimert Park where he meets up with Yolanda Hester, black doll historian. Hester reaffirms the importance Shindana and Operation Bootstrap, and how the toy factory. Nathan asks Hester how Shindana affected the neighborhood and its residents. Nathan reflects that it didn't just impact the kids who owned the dolls, it succeeded in starting a grassroots economic incubator, and the ladies at Irie Vibes. As Hester and Nathan walk through the Leimert Park, they discuss how Operation Bootstrap expanded black ownership and ironically perhaps set the seed for the community's own self-gentrification, a similar characteristic to the neighborhood around them. As their conversation concludes, Nathan reflects on how powerful a message Shindana contained for the community and how the legacy of Operation Bootstrap is still being felt today....he'll never look at a doll the same way again!","summary":"The 1965 Watts riots (also known as the Watts Rebellion or Uprising) left South Los Angeles in social and economic distress.

The whole class begins playing around until Mr. Ratburn alerts everyone to follow him. They enter the exhibition area and meet up with Ranger Ruth , who will be their fossil-hunting guide. She asks the class what a fossil is and Buster answers in a very scientific manner, much to everyone's surprise.||||| The show begins, and Ranger Ruth explains about life many years ago. How there were different plants, bugs and of course, dinosaurs. She further explains how the animals would die out. During this scene, the back person of the dinosaur costume accidentally falls backwards and runs away. Mr. Ratburn has the laughing class quiet down. Ruth continues and explains how certain parts of the bodies such as bones would last during the rotting time, and how water covered the land and eventually become rock and dirt, thus covering the remains turning them into fossils. After the show, the class heads out to hunt for fossils. On the way, Ruth talks to the children about how certain layers in the cliff date how old a certain fossil is depending on where it's found. Muffy asks how they are going to search in the cliffs, but Ruth says that they will be searching in the water.||||| In excitement, Francine rushes into the water and begins searching. Later that day, all the kids are still searching, with Buster and Arthur not having any luck. Mr. Ratburn notifies them that they will be leaving soon. Buster, in determination, wants to keep looking until they leave. Arthur protests at this, for the other students are having soda for a lunch break, and accidentally picks up a rock, which turns out to be a fossil. Buster notices and goes through a daze. Nervously, Arthur drops the fossil into the water, but Buster jumps after it and begins digging through the rocks rapidly until he finds it.

Because they are so nervous, they imagine Ruth as a dinosaur on the way out. On the way home on the bus, Arthur asks if they could tell someone about the fossil, but Buster denies this for he thinks it's too dangerous. When Buster gets home, he wraps the fossil in tinfoil, and stuffs it in a bag in a box of marbles to hide in his closet. At dinner, Buster's Mom asks her son if he found any fossils on the field trip, and he nervously says no.||||| The next day at school, Arthur asks if he can come to see the fossil, but Buster declines this for he thinks someone would see it. Arthur attempts to reason with Buster that there's no point on having the fossil if they can't even see it themselves. Mr. Ratburn enters the classroom, then talks to the class about their field trip and about how rare certain fossils are, especially footprints. In shock, Buster faints and falls backwards on his chair. Later that night, Buster is at home writing on his desk, until there is a pound on the door.

Trebol tells Luffy that he will be dealt with later, but now it is time for Doflamingo to kill Law without opposition. Luffy desperately tries to fight his way out of the mucus, and attacks Trebol using Busoshoku Haki . However, despite punching a hole through Trebol, the executive only laughs. Luffy expresses his confusion, as he thought Trebol was a Logia, but Trebol questions that assumption. Law tells Luffy it is no use, as Trebol is a papier-mache man.||||| Law states that he was glad he left the Donquixote Pirates, because otherwise he would have had to work with people like Trebol. This angers Trebol, who pins Law to the ground with mucus. Trebol then heads toward Law, pushing Doflamingo out of the way. He tells Law that Doflamingo is the absolute king, and that 31 years ago he and the three other executives discovered him and gave him power. 31 years ago, Trebol, Vergo , Diamante , and Pica confronted Doflamingo after the boy had used Haoshoku Haki on the mob that lynched his family, saying he had been chosen by heaven and offering the power to take revenge. Doflamingo then killed his father and prepared to take his head to Mary Geoise so he could become a World Noble again. Later, the four executives confronted Doflamingo again after the boy had failed to return to the World Nobles and was almost killed. The executives offered to make Doflamingo king, if he would give them their dreams as well.||||| Later, Doflamingo sat and nursed a wound. Trebol found him and found out that a man in the city had given Doflamingo the wound. The executives then enter the building where the man was and confronted him about hurting Doflamingo, which the man admitted to. Trebol then shot the man and the others around him, and told the man that they were the Donquixote Family as the man passed out. The executives later proceeded to shoot up a town that Doflamingo liked in order for him to claim it, and captured several important people before blowing them up along with their building. Later, Diamante saw Doflamingo nursing a scrape on his knee, which happened as the boy fell on an uneven road. The executives proceeded to set the entire town containing the road on fire, and as Doflamingo stood on a pile of wreckage, the executives bowed before their king. As time passed, Doflamingo and the executives went anywhere they liked and the citizens hid in fear when they arrived.||||| In the present, Trebol tells Law that Doflamingo and the executives maintained a strong bond as they gathered new crew members, and prepares to set the mucus binding Law on fire. Law just mocks him, saying Doflamingo had been using them from the start. This enrages Trebol, who leaps at Law despite Doflamingo ordering him not to as Law activates ROOM. Trebol decides to not set the mucus on fire and instead kill Law in the most painful way possible: by shoving his staff down Law's throat. However, Law says that he was a pirate captain and for the sake of his pride could not leave both Trebol and Doflamingo to Luffy as he telepathically lifts up his severed arm, which still holds his sword. Spinning it around, Law slashes Trebol up the executive's chest.||||| As this happens, the dwarves at the SMILE Factory suddenly feel like a weight has been lifted off their hearts. However, Franky tells them to focus and get out of the destroyed factory, as the Birdcage was approaching. Trebol reels in pain from the attack as the mucus covering him slips away, revealing him to be a very skinny hunchbacked man. Doflamingo angrily berates Trebol for his stupidity, and as a last resort to kill Law, Trebol spits mucus on his lighter, causing a massive explosion. The fighters on the Flower Hill and King's Plateau react in shock at the explosion, and Viola looks inside the flames. She reveals with delight that Trebol has been defeated, leaving Doflamingo the only enemy left as he escapes the flames along with Luffy, who is carrying Law. Robin sees them and is shocked at how injured he is. Luffy sees Robin and throws Law down to her, and Robin catches him with her powers . However, Doflamingo is still intent on killing Law, and fires string bullets at Robin. Luffy attempts to stop him, but is too late as the bullets fly toward the Flower Field.","summary":"Trebol immobilizes Luffy and Law and explains how he and the other three Donquixote executives found Doflamingo and raised him into the man he is today.

And that's possibly true. Klaus is still alive.\n\nBonnie did a spell that has him living in Tyler's body. It's unclear what this means for Tyler, but it's assumed that he's still alive somehow too because Bonnie wouldn't knowingly kill him. Bonnie said she saved Klaus to save her friends and her mom.\n\nSince she believes Klaus is dead, Rebekah tells Stefan that the deal is off; she's tired of running. Rebekah wants to kill Elena so Alaric dies.\n\nRebekah brings her plan to a head, by standing in front of Matt's car as he's driving Elena back into town. He swerves and the car goes over the bridge into the water, the same accident that played out with Elena's parents.\n\nThe show switches back and forth to the flashback of Elena's accident with her parents and her present accident with Matt. When Stefan comes to the rescue in the flashback, Elena's dad, who is still conscious, motions to the backseat, and Stefan saves Elena. When Stefan comes to the rescue in the present, Elena motions to Matt, Stefan resists, but Elena is insistent and Stefan saves Matt.\n\nThe scene flashes back to Damon, who has managed to gain the upperhand over Alaric. The Original tries to bring the White Oak stake down, but Damon disarms him and then Alaric suddenly starts collapsing. Real fear showing, Ric grasps Damon and dies in his arms as Elena drowns.\n\nDamon, thinking Elena has been admitted to the hospital, rushes there and Meredith confesses she cheated by giving Elena vampire blood to save her life in the previous episode because she was bleeding from the brain. Meredith did not tell Jeremy this when they earlier discussed Elena's condition. Thus meaning Elena has died with vampire blood in her system and she now awakens in her transition."}

He tells Debra that the doctor told him his adenoids have to come out. Debra tells him that it's a routine procedure and Ray is appalled at Debra's lack of concern for his well-being. Marie worriedly comes rushing in and hugs Ray, saying the doctors are \"trying to take a piece of my Raymond away.\" Ray gives Debra a hard time over the course of the next week, fretting about his upcoming surgery and asking questions such as \"What if the nurses' top button is undone and the doctor gets distracted?\" On the day of the operation, Ray goes into surgery and Debra, Robert, Amy, Frank and Marie wait in the waiting room.||||| Robert laments how the whole world has to stop because Ray is having a routine procedure, and states that the only reason he is there is because Marie dragged him there since he is the same blood type as Raymond. The family tells jokes to lighten the mood, of which Marie disapproves; she says that she needs to go to the bathroom and when she returns everyone should have a sign of concern. A few moments after Marie leaves, a nurse enters the waiting room and asks for Debra. Debra asks how the procedure went and the nurse, after asking whether Ray had any medical conditions that he did not disclose, states that they are having trouble bringing Ray out of the anesthesia. Debra starts to cry and the rest of the family (minus Marie who is in the bathroom) comes over.||||| Debra tells them what the nurse said and everyone begins to panic. Robert attempts to rush to the operating table, telling the nurse that he and Ray are the same blood type and that he can wake his brother up. Just before he walks through the door, the doctor emerges and says that everything is fine and that it occasionally happens due to hypertension. Everyone is relieved and agrees that they can't tell Ray or Marie about what happened. Later that evening, Debra brings Ray ice cream in bed. She watches as he starts eating and looks at him lovingly, telling him about what she is planning to do the next day, breaking down when she starts talking about the kids. Ray asks her if it is \"that time of the month.\" Debra begins passionately kissing Ray. Meanwhile, over at Marie's and Frank's, Frank reflects on what happened.||||| Marie notices something is up because he's too silent and he turned down dessert. She finally gets Frank to tell her what happened at the hospital and is hysterical when she finds out that \"her son almost died\" and nobody told her. Back across the street, Ray and Debra are still in bed kissing and Marie rushes into their bedroom, jumping on the bed and embracing Raymond. With a central theme of the series being Marie's coddling of Ray, an annoyed Debra says to nobody in particular, \"I knew one day this would happen.\" Ray is mortified that \"his worst nightmare is coming true\" and asks what is going on. Amy, Robert, and Frank come into the bedroom and Frank tells Ray about what happened at the hospital. Ray is furious that nobody told him, but becomes curious as to how everyone reacted when they thought he might be dead.||||| There is a pause and Ray irritably envisions what he thinks must have been going through Debra's head, saying that while she has to plan a funeral and raise three kids herself, she can finally start dating again. The scene takes on a moment of seriousness when Frank shouts at Raymond that he saw Debra fall apart in the waiting room, telling his son \"I've never seen her like that, and I'll tell you, I never want to see her like that again!\"||||| Amy says that Robert had to pull the car over on the way home from the hospital because he was crying after \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\" came on the radio (though Robert claims he pulled over because he thought he hit a cat). Everyone leaves and Debra and Ray are alone again. While one of the themes in the show has centered on Debra's constant annoyance at Ray, they both express how much they love one another. The final scene of the series shows the entire family eating breakfast together after Frank breaks Marie's stove in an attempt to \"work on it.\" Each character seems to emote an amalgam of their signature qualities as they sit and eat together, and with Ray at the center of the table, Debra tells Ray, \"It's getting a little crowded in here,\" to which Ray responds, \"Yeah, you know what? We need a bigger table.\"","summary":"Ray fears getting his adenoids removed, but Debra convinces him to go through with the surgery. At the hospital, while Marie is in the bathroom, the nurse says that Ray isn't waking up from the anesthesia and everyone fears he may die.

Everyone agrees not to tell Ray or Marie about it; however, Frank ends up telling Marie who rushes over to smother Ray with kisses.

A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: \"still life's my art,\" a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities--led by Detective LeGrand--to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives.||||| After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel's relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel's talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life.||||| Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel's excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat's apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled Metropolitan Horrors , a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures.||||| As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he's executed for the murder of the cat.

He becomes unnerved when the barmaid, Eleonora, gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel's own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome death when Rod hacks her with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong.||||| Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel's disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons. But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, she confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about her suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel's friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask about her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat from behind the wall. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump.||||| The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel's whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod isn't fazed by these questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls.||||| Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall he put up is torn down and his crime scene is gruesomely revealed: the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel's tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. Not to be outdone, Rod grabs the pick-axe from LeGrand's partner and in seconds kills both policemen. Handcuffed and in panic, Rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after hearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. Rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. But his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck, asphyxiating and killing him.

The \"boss\" is on his way. Enter Quarles stepping onto the porch with a broad smile. \"You must be the one they call 'Devil,'\" he says. Inside, Quarles explains that Tanner is a \"talent scout\" -- and has scouted Devil, who isn't exactly thrilled with how Boyd has treated him. \"You got something better?\" Devil asks. Quarles assures Devil that, yes, he does, and promises him a one-time only offer of improving his standard of living. In the prison yard, Dickie and Dewey are taking severe beatings at the hands of their fellow inmates. Moments later, they are taken to the infirmary, where corrupt guard Ash Murphy rages. Dewey wasn't supposed to be part of this \"plan.\" Lance ( Clayne Crawford ), the prison medic who is also in on the escape plan, jabs Dewey in the neck with a needle. Dewey goes limp. Problem solved... for now.||||| Later, Givens arrives at the prison to question Lance, who explains that he was injured when Dickie escaped in a coroner's van. The van is parked on the side of a rural road as Ash approaches driver Edward Fowler ( Ethan Wilde )... and shoots him dead where he sits. He then opens the back of the van to reveal the body bags containing Dickie, Dewey and an actual deceased inmate. Ash explains that he and Dickie will go after Mags' money while Dewey goes with Lance to hide out at a nearby motel.||||| Neither escapee is overly pleased. Givens then visits Loretta ( Kaitlyn Dever ), who notes that she has a few friends in her new life as a babysitter. After some banter, Givens asks about Mags' stash of money. Loretta thinks she might know where ol' Mags might just have kept that stash. Later, following Loretta's tip, Givens and Rachel arrive at Limehouse's enclave looking for Dickie, who they suspect is after his mom's money. The pair spar with Limehouse, who isn't about to give up any information. He does, however, invite the Marshals to a barbeque. \"I'm going to hook you up with some bacon you ain't never going to forget,\" Limehouse coos to Rachel, who is unimpressed.||||| Givens drives away... and is spotted by Dickie and Ash, who are parked nearby waiting to get past the police check point to the bridge into Limehouse's holler. Ash is furious to see the law, but Dickie doesn't appear to be too terribly surprised. Ash directs that, if they can't approach Limehouse directly, then Dickie will have to find a way to get the money. They repair to the motel where Dewey and Lance are holed up with the taciturn Combs ( Ed Corbin ) and his dimwit son Junior ( Adam Bartley ) who have a grudge against the Bennetts because of Mags' \"sell-out\" to the mining company. Dickie tries to call Limehouse. After one failed attempt to make contact because of caution by Limehouse's man, a connection is made after Dickie assures Limehouse that he \"knows how to talk\" on a 'phone. \"I assume you are aware of the situation up here,\" Limehouse says in reference to the police presence. Dickie is aware, which is why he needs Limehouse to personally deliver the \"package.\"||||| Devil returns to Johnny's recently reclaimed bar where Boyd hands him a small stack of bills. Devil, thinking of Quarles's proposition, wonders when Boyd plans to execute a big score. Boyd dismisses Devil, telling his flunky to be patient. Devil scowls. Then Givens enters. He inquires regarding the whereabouts of his own father and then tells the story of the night his mother finally left after years of abuse. Givens was just a boy. Mom ran to Limehouse territory, Nobles Hollow, where white women sometimes went for shelter because they knew their men wouldn't follow. Well, a drunken Arlo did follow, only to be \"felled\" by a young Limehouse when he tried to land a haymaker to the man. \"He beat him so bad that I had to drag him back to the car and drive him home myself,\" Givens concludes before revealing that he had just visited Limehouse today. Boyd wonders why such a visit occurred. Givens explains that Dickie and Dewey escaped prison. Boyd suggests that Givens take a closer look at the prison medic.||||| Later, Devil corners Johnny, asking about the low payment from Boyd. Devil reminds Johnny that he is in a wheelchair because of Boyd. \"There was a time I believed in Boyd Crowder,\" Devil says. \"But the man we have today is not that Boyd. Not by a long shot.\" Devil then tells Johnny about the Quarles deal. Givens, in the meantime, is parked outside the motel hideout after his tip from Boyd. He looks up to see Ash crossing the parking lot with a box full of coffee and take-out lunches. Ash stops dead in his tracks. The two stare at each other. Then Ash drops the food and reaches for his gun. Givens slams on the gas pedal and the car hurtles forward into Ash, knocking him down. When the guard somehow manages to stand and awkwardly start shooting, Givens throws the car into reverse, hitting him again. Givens then goes inside the motel room to find a cigarette still burning, but no escapees. Just then, a van peels out of the motel parking lot, closely followed by a car. Lance, Dickie, Dewey and the Combs, father and son, have left the scene.||||| Givens then extracts info from the seriously injured Ash. The plan is for Limehouse to bring Mags' money to her old store, where Dickie will meet him. Givens calls Rachel, who reports that she has just turned around a truck full of pig manure at the police check point and sent it back into the holler, and that she hasn't let any traffic out of Limehouse's holler. Realizing that Mags' money will not be delivered and that Dickie might just die because of that, Givens curses as he suspects that he now might have to save Dickie Bennett. Dickie, meanwhile, is forced into his mom's old store at gunpoint by the Combs father and son. The place has been trashed. Dickie begins looking behind the wall for the money and pulls out a battered cooler. He slowly lifts the lid when there is a pair of blasts. Ash's accomplices fall dead... and out steps Limehouse who took an old underground railroad trail to evade the police checkpoint at the bridge.||||| Overjoyed, Dickie opens the cooler to reveal a measly amount of cash, $46,313 to be precise. \"There was supposed to be $3 million in there!\" Dickie exclaims. Limehouse calmly explains that it was spent by Mags to buy up surrounding property, and that there are receipts for everything. Dickie, who suspects Limehouse, pushes away the money. He refuses to accept that amount. Dickie only asks for a shotgun, and Limehouse directs his associate to unload his and give it to Dickie. \"Are you good with this, Mr. Bennett?\" asks Limehouse. Dickie just laughs in disbelief. After Limehouse exits with his cohort, Givens pulls up to the store to hear shotgun blasts. He enters to find Dickie sitting inside. The escapee has been firing off random shots. \"I hereby surrender,\" Dickie says. \"To be very clear, I am the victim here,\" and Givens agrees, and wonders where Dewey might be.||||| Dewey has been taped to a chair in a hotel room by the medic. Lance then wheels Dickie past a long row of surgical tools. He spreads a tarp on the bed. Dewey screams -- and Lance again injects him. Once more, Dewey goes limp. The medic then calls someone on his cell. \"I may have a way for us to make some more money.\" Back at Johnny's bar, Devil and Johnny approach Boyd. Devil explains that this particular conversation has been a longtime coming.||||| Devil then pulls a gun and aims it at Boyd who feigns resignation and regret, then asks for a final indulgence from his wouldbe executioner, one last question. \"Whatever led you in your imagination to believe you could pull this off?\" Johnny then puts a gun on Devil, whose mouth drops open. Boyd rises, gun in hand, and shoots Devil in the chest. \"All I ever asked for was your loyalty,\" Boyd whispers to the stricken man who have pledged his loyalty, then reneged. \"Hurts, don't it,\" Boyd says. \"I know, I've been there, too.

Van Buren claims that he was trying to rob her with another young man, but doubt is cast on her story as he was unarmed and shot in the back. Despite being ordered not to, Logan and Briscoe investigate the supposed robbery while McCoy takes Van Buren to the grand jury with a murder indictment.||||| Despite McCoy going after her aggressively and claiming she may have been frustrated that more non-white kids being arrested than white kids, the jury ultimately doesn't indict her, but McCoy believes it is because they want her on the streets stopping people committing crimes by any means necessary. As a result of the shooting, Van Buren is ordered to see Doctor Olivet and she believes that killing James was a mistake, but is also angered that after all she has done in her 12 year career she is starting to lose everything. Briscoe and Logan come up with a theory based on Van Buren's story of what might've happened: the second kid, the one with the gun faces off with Van Buren who pulls her gun and shoots him in a non-fatal spot like the arm or the leg, but the bullet goes through the limb and kills James.||||| Briscoe and Logan check into hospital records and find a kid who got shot in the arm and took off before the cops could check it out. They find out that he used the alias of a dead gangbanger who was pretty popular. The two speak to Detective Brian Keene who had arrested the gangbanger several times and confirms that he's still popular enough that several kids might use his name as an alias. Keene points them to where those kids would hang out and they spot a kid with an arm wound named Zack Rowland and arrest him. While he confirms that he and James did try to rob Van Buren, he claims they were unarmed and tried to rob through intimidation and she went crazy and started shooting. They are unable to locate Zack's gun, but with the help of James' girlfriend Gwen, they find it and it matches Van Buren's description of the gun pulled on her, seemingly proving her story. They also learn that Zack's brother stole it and sold it to him which strengthens their case.||||| McCoy charges Zack with murder for his part in James' death who had a very low IQ and according to his teacher and Doctor Ollivet's assessment of him, didn't have the mental capacity to plan the robbery with the teacher believing he was likely tricked into it, believing it was a game. McCoy hides that James needed money to buy Gwen an ID bracelet and had \"a way\" of getting it which could prove that he was willingly in on the robbery, but the defense finds out and puts her on the stand. However, McCoy and Kincaid recall that the teacher had told them that James had needed her help to learn how to write Gwen's name and it would be printed on the bracelet, but he'd gotten the help some time before his death.||||| Realizing that James may have already gotten the bracelet which would negate his motive for committing robbery, McCoy sends Van Buren to ask James' mother about the bracelet. Mrs. Gordon refuses to help Van Buren as she killed her son, but when Van Buren reveals her immense guilt over his death and asks her to help prevent more kids from dying on the streets, the mother reveals that James did buy the bracelet, having presumably sold valuable baseball cards he collected for the money. Having gotten the bracelet from the mother, they are able to disprove the defense's story and Zack Rowland cuts a deal. Later, McCoy and Van Buren meet at a bar and McCoy reveals that his father was a cop and if his father had been in the same situation, both kids would've been dead, not just one. McCoy tells Van Buren that he would've taken his father to the grand jury if that had happened and would've gotten him convicted, indicating that he probably was going easy on Van Buren when he had her on trial.","summary":"The police find themselves investigating one of their own when Lt. Van Buren shoots a young intellectually disabled boy at an ATM. She's certain that one of the boys had a gun and Capt. Dennis Burnett tells everyone to stay out of the investigation but Detectives Lenny Briscoe and Mike Logan can't help but look into the case. They find the second boy, Zack Rowland, and McCoy for his part takes the case to a grand jury who refuse to indict Van Buren. She's not happy however because a non-indictment isn't the same as being found innocent. When Logan and Briscoe find the gun Zack used, they have to find a way to prove he had it in his possession."}

First up is Rayna-Deacon-Luke.||||| Rayna is confused about what to do, and after a romp with Luke in the hay, talks to Tandy about it the next morning. Tandy can't believe that she would even consider getting back together with Deacon but knows Rayna has to make her own choice. In order to assist in this choice Rayna feels like she has to tell Luke what happened with Deacon. He is understandably upset but also gets where Deacon is coming from, not wanting to lose Rayna again, but he says if it's up to him Deacon will lose indeed.

He says he knows she needs to think about it and if she doesn't want to attend a charity event he has that evening she doesn't have to.||||| She goes home and pulls out her old albums that feature Deacon and plays them and reminisces, both about good times singing onstage and not so good ones when he was drunk and awful and including one time when Luke subbed for Deacon at one of her shows when Deacon was a no-show.

Meanwhile, Helen is getting married, and with many of her family members staying in her apartment, her grandmother Lula comes to stay at the Parker-Nichols' house for a week, forcing Drake and Josh to share their room with Megan due to Lula staying in her's instead of the guest room.

To save money for her upcoming honeymoon, Helen makes a deal with Craig and Eric to videotape her wedding.\n\nHelen then promotes the Premiere's latest employee and Josh's ex-girlfriend, Mindy Crenshaw, as its new assistant manager for fixing a corn dog rotisserie that Josh was unable to fix. Josh is distraught over not getting the position and accuses Mindy of constantly trying to do better than him, which she denies.

Drake and Josh then go to Spin City Records and as they are prepared to face the consequences, company president Nick Matteo says that Drake's song has become a number one hit with downloads of it crashing their website's server. The duo are freed of the charges and an outraged Krim is fired for his actions.\n\nAt Helen's wedding, Craig plugs his equipment into a faulty plug, which causes a fire that sets the Premiere ablaze. Helen is disappointed at her wedding being ruined, but Josh convinces her that weddings are about two people who love each other getting together surrounded by the people who love them. The wedding soon resumes in the parking lot, where Josh and Mindy get back together. Mindy has quit her job and Helen finally gives Josh the assistant manager position for his years of hard work. Drake then performs his song to the crowd, dedicating it to the newlyweds as well as Josh, rehiring him as his manager in the process.\n\nDrake and Josh later return home to find their room restored to its former state as well as prawns sent over from Nick Matteo.

A student, Brian Wilcox, is filming footage at a diner... Brian is at the diner with his friend and roommate Mike Walker, debating about what Brian should make a movie about. As Mike goofs off with his friend's camera, they spot several girls at a booth nearby and Mike good-naturedly suggests they might take pity on Brian. One of the girls, Kate, comes over and asks if they're filming her. She discusses camera technology with Brian but is clearly attracted to Mike.||||| Later, Brian is at the house. Kate and Mike are in the next room making love. Once they're done, Kate comes out, awkwardly says hi to Brian, and goes to the kitchen. Brian, Mike, and Kate go back to the diner and Brian and Kate talk cameras. Mike doesn't know anything about cameras but Kate assures Brian that she's teaching her boyfriend about them. The friends film each other talking about what they plan to do in five years. Kate wants to be an environmentalist, a lawyer, or both.||||| Brian wants to work in Hollywood, and Mike plans to set sail to the middle of the ocean and take things easy. Brian is filming a literature lecture by Professor Ludensky on Lord of the Flies. Kate comes in and confirms that Brian is taping for Mike, who has dozed off again. As they leave, another student, Scott Parker bumps into Brian, knocking his camera to the ground. He runs off and the three friends follow. The police are securing a nearby crime scene where a student, Jacob Carter, was brutally murdered. Sam and Dean, posing as FBI agents, are on the scene. The detective in charge tells them that a neighbor woman reported growling noises and Jacob screams.||||| Back at their house, the three friends discuss what they saw and figure that it's a good thing that the FBI is checking out the murder. Mike puts on the song that was playing at the diner when he first met Kate as a gift to her. Brian asks him to come with him to test some new cameras and Mike agrees. Before he goes, he privately tells Kate that he's going because Brian doesn't have any other friends. Brian and Mike film some footage of the stadium and spot Sam and Dean nearby. They listen in as Sam figures that it's a normal murder but Dean believes that they need to dig deeper. As night falls, Brian and Mike spot Scott and his girlfriend making out behind the bleachers.

Scott and his friends are out patrolling the neighborhood, looking for the killer animal.||||| Scott films himself and spots Mike, who says that he isn't in the mood for Scott's antics.

He tells the brothers that the same thing killed Scott as Jacob and that it left Scott's partially-eaten heart in the street. Michael goes back and tells his friends what happened, but Mike doesn't remember eating the heart. Kate insists that it was self-defense but Brian points out how unlikely that is and snaps at Mike. Mike shoves him across the room with one hand and then creaks down. When he says that he doesn't know who he is anymore, Kate says that he's hers. Brian insists that they have to call the police and that Mike is risking himself and them.||||| Kate angrily tells him that he doesn't understand because he's never been in love and sets out to get some answers about Mike's condition.

The brothers figure that one of the purer werewolves came to town, killed its victim, and then decided to stay.||||| The three friends return to their house and Mike starts to panic, figuring the 'FBI' is after him. Kate doesn't believe that the Winchesters are FBI and that they'll start by looking for the pureblood. Mike doesn't believe it and goes to his bedroom and Kate goes after him. They argue while Brian goes over the footage of the original attack on Mike. He spots something on the ground and calls to Kate, but she slams the door shut. Brian has no choice but to go out on his own and examine the attack site. He finds a pin on the ground and realizes that it's the same one that Ludensky was wearing at his last lecture.||||| Brian goes to Ludensky's office and tells him that he knows what the professor really is. Later, Brian comes home and finds Kate packing. As Mike comes out, Brian says that he took care of things and they ask what he did. He shows them footage of his confronting Ludensky and asking the professor to bite him as well. He warns the professor that he hid cameras in his office in advance and is transmitting the video to his laptop at home. Ludensky denies being a werewolf until Brian threatens him with a silver blade. Then he breaks down and explains that after the one murder ten years ago, he only ate animal hearts. However, he saw Jacob, weak and alone, and couldn't resist. Ludensky figured that hunters would come eventually so he needed a patsy. He chose Mike since he's always sleeping in and the professor figured that no one would miss him.

Brian, angry and disgusted, tells Mike that he's tired of living in his shadow and that he finally has what he wants. Mike tries to persuade his friend that he doesn't want the horror inside of him, the horror that he experienced when he went out of control and killed Scott. Brian tells Kate that she needs him and grabs her, and Mike transforms and attacks him. The two students struggle and Brian stabs Mike with the silver dagger, killing him. Kate goes to her lover, who says with his dying breath that he loves her.||||| Kate tries to stab Brian, who easily grabs her and says that she'll understand... and then bites her.

Much to his surprise, Dean agrees, saying that they should give Kate a chance. They can always kill her if she fails to keep her promise.

Michael is bitten by a mysterious creature and begins exhibiting supernatural traits. Things get out of hand when he kills a bully (Eric Banerd) in a fit of rage for threatening Kate. Trying to find out what's happening to Michael, the three film students spy on Sam and Dean, who are trying to find a werewolf who's been biting and killing people at the college the students attend. Sam and Dean reveal that this werewolf is a \"pureblood\" werewolf that possesses some unique qualities, including retaining a greater degree of awareness when it transforms, compared to other werewolves. Brian privately realizes that the pure-blood werewolf is one of his professors ( David Lewis ). Brian blackmails the professor into turning him, Brian, into a werewolf. He tells the horrified Michael and Kate what he's done, revealing that he did it because he is jealous of Michael for having power and Kate's love. The two boys fight, and Brian kills Michael in the struggle before turning Kate into a werewolf against her will so that they can be together. However, a vengeful Kate kills Brian instead. The two bodies Sam and Dean found at the house are Brian and Michael. Kate edits all their footage together into a movie for Sam and Dean to watch and understand what happened, finishing with a promise that she will feed off of animal hearts and not harm humans, asking for a chance to live in peace. At that point, Sam and Dean (having killed Brian's professor before tracing one of Brian's cameras to the students' home at the start of the episode) finish watching the video. Because Kate is a pureblood werewolf who can control herself and hasn't hurt anyone human, Sam and Dean agree to give her the chance she asked for."}
